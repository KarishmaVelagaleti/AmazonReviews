       "'Purchased this for my device, it worked as advertised. You can never have too much phone memory, since I download a lot of stuff this was a no brainer for me. it works as expected. I should have sprung for the higher capacity.  I think its made a bit cheesier than the earlier versions; the paint looks not as clean as before This think has worked out great.Had a diff. bran 64gb card and if went south after 3 months.This one has held up pretty well since I had my S3, now on my Note3.*** update 3/21/14I\\'ve had this for a few months and have had ZERO issue\\'s since it was transferred from my S3 to my Note3 and into a note2. This card is reliable and solid!Cheers! Bought it with Retail Packaging, arrived legit, in a orange envelope, english version not asian like the picture shows. arrived quickly, bought a 32 and 16 both retail packaging for my htc one sv and Lg Optimus, both cards in working order, probably best price you\\'ll get for a nice sd card It\\'s mini storage.  It doesn\\'t do anything else and it\\'s not supposed to.  I purchased it to add additional storage to my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet which only come in 64 and 128 GB.  It does what it\\'s supposed to and SanDisk has a long standing reputation that speaks for itself. I have it in my phone and it never skips a beat. File transfers are speedy and have not had any corruption issues or memory fade issues as I would expect from the Sandisk brand. Great card to own. Why entrust your precious files to a slightly cheaper piece of crap? If you lose everything can you forgive yourself for not spending the extra couple bucks on a trusted product that goes through good QA? It\\'s hard to believe how affordable digital has become. 32 GB in a device one quarter the sie of postage stamp would have been science fiction less than a generation ago.I picked this up for portable music when I didn\\'t want to schlep (or risk) a phone or iPod. Works great with all SD card readers.Select with confidence. Works in a HTC Rezound.  Was running short of space on a 64GB Sandisk so I ordered this when it came out, fast and no issues. in my galaxy s4, super fast card, and am totally happy, not happy having to still type to fill the required words though I like this SD Card because it can take music video downloads, personal videos, files,docs, and multimedia images with a fast transfer rate of Class 10 speed. It can take games with large files very easily and still have enough space for apps. It&#34;s great for video cameras and camcorders with the supplied adapter. Fits very easily into smartphones and tablets SD Card slots. I recommend this 32GB SD Card to everyone. It works, but file writes are a bit slower than expected on a USB3 reader.Also, both reads and writes are FASTER with the card inside the standard-size SD adapter (15 MB/s vs 10 write; 45 MB/s vs 22 MB/s read) on the same card reader.  Can\\'t figure why... THE NAME OF ITSELF SPEAKS OUT. GO SANDISK GO! Solid SDHC card that is fast (at reading and writing) fast (for recording video and pics), has great capacity, and is reasonably priced. I have had no issues with it.Overall, highly recommend. Heard that the card\\'s write speed is insufficient, however I have used it extensively and haven\\'t had a single problem with it!! I bought this to use with my go pro hero 3 black edition. It requires a class 10 MicroSDXC card. So far I\\'ve had no issues with it. Fast read/write, came with adapter, small packaging, but that\\'s all it needed! Comes with a nice hard plastic case to keep both dry and together if needed. got this because i had a 2 GB one that filled up. i kept getting the insufficient disk space on my phone. my kids take my phone and do selfies. mostly my daughter. I had to get a bigger card. the 2GB one was a carry over from an old phone.needless to say this was sweet. plenty of space. and i dont have to delete pictures anymore. well for now at least.my daughter loves selfies. Class 10 Speed Rating for Seamless Full HD VideoThe SanDisk Ultra UHS-I card features a Class 10 and UHS Speed Class 1 (U1) rating, the highest video performance available for recording uninterrupted Full HD** video.Flawless App PerformanceThis card can retrieve stored data almost instantly, thanks to its up to 30MB/s read capability and fast bus interface. The SanDisk Ultra microSDHC and microSDXC UHS-I cards offer faster app loading and smoother, more fluid app performance.Storage Capacities Up to 64GBThis card has plenty of room to accommodate Full HD videos, MP3s, apps, and other memory-intensive mobile files. Available in sizes up to 64GB, it can store all the apps, music, and video you want.Android App for Easy File ManagementThe included SanDisk Memory Zone app lets you easily view, access, and backup all of your digital files from your phone\\'s memory, additional memory card, and cloud service all in one convenient place. Using the app, you can easily move files from your card to a number of cloud storage services.Durable DesignSanDisk Ultra UHS-I memory cards can capture memories from -13 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit with a shockproof, waterproof, and X-ray-proof design. Your mobile device may not survive, but your SanDisk memory card will. The read and write speeds are better than the Samsung SD card that I had previously. I would not hesitate to buy another one of these great Micro SD cards from SanDisk. I also own their Clip plus MP3 player and it works very well. I think I\\'m becoming a fan of the SanDisk products. This works with the NL1520.  No video stuttering like with the 64gb.  Blah blah blah blah to fill in the rest. Works as expected.  High transfer speed.  Nice to have extra microSD adapters lying around since I always seem to misplace them.  Mainly bought it to use in my Nikon DSLR since I can put the card directly into my (CM modded) Nook HD+ tablet in the field and view my images on a larger screen. Works great in a Samsung Galaxy S3.  Formatted straight away, full size there.  I can\\'t really tell the speed difference between this one and a slower card it replaced.  I guess the IO in the phone can\\'t take advantage. SanDisk never disappoints. As always SanDisk products are worth every penny. Nice product and quality and works great. I recommend this product to everyone. Good price, works flawless in my Samsung S4! Normal SanDisk quality! That is why I go with this brand and only this brand.. San disk is hard to beat.  You will pay more for the brand but you get a quality product.  Would purchase again. Installed in my Blackberry Q10 SQN100-1 and formatted. Works just fine. Plenty of storage space for pictures and videos of my son at the park. I just received my card, it is the class 10 64GB with the correct serial#SDSDQUA-064G-A11A. I received it in an unopened SanDisk packaging. I am going to use it on my HTC Rezound, I hope it works. From what I have read, it will work after reformatting the disk. I will update this review if I have any issues using it, if not, my rating will remain unchanged... Stuck it in my S2, formatted in settings, works great! Already filled with music, pics and videos...  Get this card, format it right, and you\\'ll have no problems.  If your phone won\\'t do it right, should have got a Samsung! haha... I purchased two of these one for my Samsung tablet and one for my samsung galaxy note. Great hardware that is truly speedy, responsive and meets my needs! As advertised, specs match.  As long as the device you as using it in can handle it (i.e. USB 3.0, not some crapple bs) it delivers the advertised speed.  P.S. The speed is READ, not WRITE, but you knew that, right? This item is great!  I can\\'t believe how small it is.  Imagine 64gb this size back in the 70\\'s when they had whole buildings full of computers that couldn\\'t pack this much space!  Great item. I\\'ve been trying for a while to get a hold of a 32GB Micro SD for my phone and tablet.  It\\'s pretty fast compared to the 16GB cards I\\'ve been using.  I really saw the performance boost with my phone, which I have many apps, pictures, music, and other documents on.  The phone boots fully stable in about 2 mins as apposed to 5-6 mins.  My computer also can write to these cards much faster than the 16GB ones I was using.  If you phone, tablet or any other device can support it I recommend you purchase these.  Also you pay like half the price using Amazon as opposed to other retail stores who\\'s price is at least double or more.  I\\'ve seen these same cards going for about $72 in my area. I bought 2 of those SanDisk 32 GB microSD , used them on my Galaxy Note and Galaxy S4First one , my phone started saying it was removed , then recognize it again :) then diedI thought it\\'s just a luck , plugged in the 2nd one :) stayed for about 2 months and died suddenly ! and lost everythingnever buying from SanDisk again .. ever The memory card is an excellent condition and work as described. Dependable and easy to use. An excellent choice for the enthusiast who requires more storage. I\\'ve got a couple of these in varying sizes. I\\'ve had no problems and no complaints about speed. I always end up buying more because the prices are so low for what you get. I only had 8 gigs of memory on my Note 2 and was running out of room. Now I have so much memory space available I don\\'t know what to do with it. Bought it for my Surface Pro. I\\'ve had it in there for a few months and I\\'ve had no problems. Very fast and stable. I would recommend this card to everyone.Data Transfer speeds - excellent with this card on my Galaxy S2.  Didn\\'t need to format the card or anything. I am 100% satisfied. I bougth this micro SD card after some trubles with other that i got from Kingston, i can tell that SanDisk is other quality, this is the best, my i9300 phone can read a 64GB very fast, the dta transfer speed from my pc to my is amazing, if you are looking for additional storage to you phone, for music, pictures and other type of files, this is for you.Pros-Very good quality materials of construction-Amazing speedUpdate after one year this memory is damaged I can not delete or put new files on it, I can not format this memory, I tried to format with my phone, with my pc, with a camera and nothing, now this is like a 64gb cd, the data in the memory is only available to read but I can not move, or delete it, I bought this memory to be used to backup all my data of my android device but now is only a readable memory I can not write data on it any more, I hope sandisk make a better products in the future!!! Total disagree I will buy a Samsung memory card expected a better quality. Using this in a contout gps camera,  don\\'t waste your time buying any other brand it will be a waste. Buy the best to start with. This is a fantastic little drive, has all the gigabytes it says, works in all ways I can discern and I use it to hold the flac recordings I play on my excellent Fiio X5 digital audio player. This is the real thing and not one of the fakes that, evidently, are out there. I am very happy with this Micro SD.  I could tell the difference in the response time in my BB curve as well as my Asus tablet.  If you want something that can transfer files Photos, Videos, and Music faster this is the Micro SD card for you. Now I will say this there are faster cards out there but not at this price.  This does the trick for my devices.  Now it you are a Professional Photographer you might want to go with the Ultra 3 Micro SD but if you are an everyday user this will work wonders for you device. I\\'ve purchased several of these little babies over the years, and I always buy SanDisk. I\\'ve never had one fail, the price is great for the amount of storage you get. Ordered this for a Galaxy S3.  Lasted a few months and then broke.  Is not accessible on several different PC\\'s.Says \"limited lifetime\" warranty - BS.  You have ONE MONTH for Eco Zone.  Not only did I lose pictures but now I am out $$ because of a crappy return policy.In the future I will be buying Kingston, not Sandisk.-----------------Update:  Amazon Customer service made good and refunded my purchase price.  I still will not be buying any more Sandisk memory cards however... more like 8mb/s in my Note 10.1 and that\\'s using SanDisk\\'s own app. A bit faster in my Note II, but still a disappointment for devices with quad core processors. Not sure if it\\'s the card or the device, so benefit of the doubt and four stars. not much to say other than plug and play, good quality and fits a lot of video ...good good good A new camcorder required fast SD (micro) and SanDisk products have always provided first class service, so the extra cost is well worth it. This tiny marvel does what it claims.  The only possible problem is that it is SO small that you may lose it if you happen to drop it during handling.  But with 16 GB capacity, you won\\'t be handling it often. It does the job and the price was right. It came quickly so I\\'m very happy for the purchase.  I would recommend it and would but it again. I used this for a few months in my phone, then it decided to quit mounting. I lost some pictures of pets who died shortly after. I got a replacement card, but I had to send in the old one, giving up any chance of recovering its contents. The new one\\'s worked fine, but failing after 3 months in inexcusable. A memory card either works or it doesn\\'t. This was always going to be a one star or five star review - no middle ground.The adapter is a nice bonus too, though I don\\'t think I have anything to use it with. I purchased this card to use in my ContourROAM2 and it works great.  All I had to do was put the card in the camera, format it, and I was good to go.  It allows me to easily record hours of 720p/60fps video without running out of space or slowing down. Upgraded from 32GB to 64GB card for my Galaxy Note phone.  Looks like it works fine and has full capacity.  Good product. everything about it was great, except for the adapter.  It was to tight i had to use a tool to take it back out of the adapter causing me to chip it. so my fault i guess, but i also bought a 16gb version and the adapter for that one was fine. Liked the first one I purchased so much, I bought a second one. Very, very fast read and write speeds at a good price, plus SanDisk has the best software and device compatibility.  Forget thumb drives - this is your most flexible, durable option.  Use direct in your tablet or smart phone and/or buy a decent usb card reader you can load this in and, voila, instant super-speedy, upgradeable thumb drive.  Works great in my tablet and in my newer card reader - and still kicks the butt of every thumb drive I know of even when used with my old plastic USB 2.0 card reader held together with scotch tape, lol.  Have purchased several microSD cards since they first came out, from 2GB to 32GB, and all still work fine - I cannot say the same re the thumb drives I purchased during that same time period.One point - beware of counterfeits.  Samsung is the number one brand so, unfortunately, they get counterfeited a LOT.  So check reviews and only buy from a reliable seller.  I suggest buying direct from Amazon (or Memory Mogul) - I have purchased from both with no issues. Really you can\\'t say anything bad about it. Does what it says. Super fast and great storage size for lots of movies and such. Used in my phone it\\'s plenty fast and works just like it should. Unexpectedly comes with mini and full SD card size adapters, which is nice. &#34;Fool-proof&#34; packaging or whatever it was, that was laughable. Packaging was decent it just shouldn\\'t have bragged about being impossible to mess up when I messed it up. This is just the standard micro SD card i would recommend this to anyone. i purchased this for my dad who is using it to expand the memory on his tablet! it shipped fast and is a slight bit cheaper than in the stores i believe. I ordered this for my new Samsung Galaxy note II, and it works awesome! Installed it, and had no problems. I loaded all my music on it, and didn\\'t even scratch the surface of the capacity of this card! I shouldn\\'t ever have to worry about running outta room with this card. Highly recommended for any smartphone user! Great Deal and much faster file movement.Definitely worth the purchase and sandisk has proved why they have good products. You\\'ll pay $10 more for these anywhere else. I was initially leery of buying another SD card on amazon. 4 years ago I did so, and the card was a fake (said it had 32 gigs when plugged into the computer, but you could only load about 11 onto it, and it would say &#34;full.&#34; Apparently there\\'s a way to fool your computer into thinking there\\'s more space than there is, and this is what the fake/counterfeit cards will do).Not so with this one. It\\'s the real deal, genuine SanDisk, and contains as many GB as it says it does. I\\'m a very pleased customer. Use this in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Have had it for almost a year now, no problems, really expands your memory capabilities, easy enough to install. 32gb of storage for my new Asus tablet, what\\'s not to love? I can\\'t imagine paying more for the model with the upgraded storage, especially since it\\'s usually like $100 more. This thing was cheap and works great. excellent quality, excellent speed. no complaints here. very easy to use, reliable and the red stripe on the front makes it easy to find on a crowded desk This card advertises itself as UHS1 but it\\'s actually UHS50.This means that it will not go up to SDR104 speeds/throughput.Not necessary bad, just false advertising. Purchase for HP tablet to have more memory for music download, pictures, and video.  Have enough room to store and some memory left over. Can there be anything wrong with a sandisk product?  the items read to it sooooo quickly, I am quite happy, A lot of people want big memory which is fine. But you need to look at speed class. This one is class 10. Which is great when your taking pictures or video. It will not freeze because it can move the MB/s fast enough. Lesser speed cards will freeze or will say waiting for camera and you will miss the moment. Its also a Sandisk which is a name you can trust when it come to memory cards. fast transfer rates, I downloaded about 2GB of videos form the card to my laptop through a card reader, all in about a minute There is something to be said about SanDisk. You plug it in and it just works. I\\'ve never had one be DOA or any memory issues throughout the years, both for my camera and storage products. I installed this in my Galaxy SIII and it recognized it right away and I was able to dump my music onto it. Speed seems great as well, no complaints. How do I praise extra memory? It fills my MP3 player with every song my heart desires, the sound quality is perfect. The ease of use is superb. It\\'s great. All though it states 16gig it only has 14.8gig available but I know that happens and expected it, keep this in mind if your wanting more storage you might want to order the 32gig card.  It was exactly what i expected and needed so no complaints. does the job as advertised.if you need extra memory on your phone/tablet or whatever device, this is bext buy(price/quality) Needed for my cell phone - works perfectly.  SanDisk has never been a disappointment in the 30 plus years I\\'ve been in IT/computer work. Priced right, this memory card also reads and writes fast. It\\'s a noticeable difference over cheaper cards. I put it in my phone and plan to buy another one for my tablet. works great on my sprint htc evo 4g lte.  Formatted w/ fat32 so of course the maximum file size is 4gb meaning no full length hidef movies.  However, this isn\\'t a problem;  I bought the card for putting a music library on my phone.Like all class 10 micro-sdhc cards, it does NOT do 10MB/s, but it\\'s closer than any other class 10 card I\\'ve ever tried.  Most do 3-4MB/s.  Kingston 32GB did 7MB/s.  This card does about 8-9MB/s.Can\\'t wait till 128GB and 256GB cards become available and affordable. **Update 6.24.14**My 128 GB card stopped allowing writes via any of my card-readers on a Windows PC--either when it was inside any of several full-size SD card adapters (with the write-protect tab in either position) or plugged directly into the microSD slot of the reader.  MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this.  After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect error.  If anyone has a similar problem, I\\'d recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item.  This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card:I don\\'t need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I didn\\'t count off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might be relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed \"read speeds up to 30 MB/s for fast file transfer.\"  Then again, running on a second PC using a different USB 2.0 card reader, none of the speeds even hit 5 MB/s, so this seems to be highly system-dependent.I only just got the card this week, and so far it works on *select* SDXC-compatible devices and exFAT-compatible operating systems:  some SDXC-compatible devices, such as the Panasonic HDC-TM40, do not allow cards larger than 64 GB (for whatever reason); this was stated in the manual, and I\\'ve confirmed this card is recognized as broken/corrupt/unusable in that device, whereas 64 GB exFAT cards work fine.  The 128 GB works fine (with original exFAT formatting) in my Toshiba Excite 7.7 Android tablet, and (predictably) not at all in my non-SDXC-compatible Galaxy Note 2 (though it possibly would if reformatted to FAT32, since a 64 GB card in FAT32 works fine there).I\\'ll update my review to reflect any problems, issues, etc that I notice in the coming days & weeks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World : [url removed as per Amazon rules]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read : 18.694 MB/sSequential Write : 11.921 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 18.502 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 0.680 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.339 MB/s [ 815.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 1.581 MB/s [ 386.1 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 3.151 MB/s [ 769.4 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 1.564 MB/s [ 381.8 IOPS]Test : 1000 MB [G: 0.0% (0.0/119.1 GB)] (x5)Date : 2014/04/24 16:53:49OS : Windows XP Professional SP3 [5.1 Build 2600] (x86)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, published April 24, 2013:This is a high-quality card.  I\\'ve used it in a variety of devices, through multiple readers on different pcs, in an HD camcorder using a micro to full-sized SD adapter, and I\\'ve never once had a problem with it.  It even works at full capacity in *some* microSDHC-only devices once its reformatted to FAT32 (such as my SanDisk Clip+ FLAC player and supposedly even PSPs via a proper adapter, though I haven\\'t yet tested my PSP).  I keep anticipating someone coming out with a card with equal or better capacity and speeds at a comparable price, but I haven\\'t seen one yet.  If these were cheaper, I\\'d have several by now.Make sure your device can handle micro or full-sized SDXC cards, or is one of those rare gems that state they support only as high as SDHC but have been tested to work with SDXC cards such as this one once they\\'ve been manually reformatted to FAT32. Works great in the phone and the wife loves it, we got a second for her mom and she is storing lots of pictures and videos on it I loaded this card up with home movies for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. The copy process from computer to card was fast. There are no skips in the movie quality and I have plenty of room left to go. Wish I had bought another for more collections. Bought this for my S3 and loaded it with 4 seasons of Futurama, 5 full length HD movies, several documentaries, and a dozen or so 30 minute comedy shows with plenty of room left over for pictures, etc...Only slight nitpick is when booting up into recovery mode on the S3 it will not recognize the card. Wanted to update the phone to the latest version of Android and it would not see it. Had to resort to a 2GB MicroSD I had laying around. That wasn\\'t a SD card issue but I thought I would throw that in. I purchased this after my wife and I bought our Samsung Galaxy S4 to store all the music, pictures and videos.  The S4 camera is capable of capturing 16-megapixels photos so the 16GB microSD that I had will not suffice.  As a matter of fact I\\'ve already exhausted the remaining space on the card so this 64GB will allow me to take more photos (of our son). Great storage, has not failed yet after about a year of usage. Since the wife is using it and it is not causing any problems, then it must be functioning normally. Looks good so far. Class 10 speeds are the only way to fly and with 29.71GB of usable space I think I should be good for a while. The subject says it all.  Does what it\\'s supposed to do ... at a great price.  When it\\'s on sale, buy it. Lot of questions about this memory card fitting the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 tablet.  It fits and works no problem at all. The only thing is that after installing, instead of showing 64GB available, it only shows 59GB.Tried formatting the card but with same results.Have no idea if this is a limit set by the the Galaxy Tab 3 tablet, or is it just &#34;normal&#34; to buy 64GB and get less than that.As this is surely not a problem coming from the Sandisk memory card, my rating is a 5-STAR.  Excellent price, works great, and very quick delivery. When it comes to any kind of flash storage SanDisk has always been my go to brand because they sell quality items and stand by them if there\\'s a problem. So as usual no complaints here, it works as descried and I haven\\'t have any issues. Both read and write speeds are right where the specs say they should be. High speed, high capacity of storage. Great durability. I use in my phone and in my digital camera. Work very good THis memory helps me to keep all what I want to keep on my cell phone.It is a good brand and its on the right price. I bought this SD card for my android phone thinking that a class 10 will be faster and more reliable than others. it turns out, the difference in class doesn\\'t really matter at least for Android phones. didn\\'t really worth the price difference The SanDisk 32GB Micro SD Class 10 is a reliable SD card with amazing transfer speeds. There is no noticeable lag transfering even the largest RAW images to it. Hadn\\'t had any problem with it. good card. work as describes. haven\\'t had any issue with it or going pass metal detectors. no lost files or missing files. Bought this to store music on my phone. Works flawlessly after three months so far, no problems.In my card reader, I average 6-8 megabytes read and write to it. I\\'m amazed.  I ordered this from Amazon on Tuesday morning, and it arrived with Wednesday\\'s mail.  VERY impressive service from Amazon!As has already been reported, the card formats out to > 59 Gb, and it performs perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy S III (which is also new).  Using two card readers on a fast PC, I transferred everything from my old 16GB card to the new 64 GB card in less time than it took to walk to the kitchen and get a cup of coffee.  So I think the Class 10 rating is correct on the card.Once I have some experience with the card in the phone, I\\'ll benchmark the card and I\\'ll also benchmark operations such as internally backing up my Android phone to the card.  Then I\\'ll update this review with some accurate numerical data.  But in the mean time on first look, the person who said that the S 3 has problems with anything faster than class 6 may not have been correct - a full backup of the phone to the card was significantly faster than the backup with the old 16GB class 6 card.  Again no benchmarks yet but once I have them I\\'ll include them here.Right now I\\'m very happy with this card and I\\'m really impressed - both with the card and with the unbelievably quick service from Amazon (and I\\'m in Atlanta where shipments like this one often take the full 3 days to arrive). Excellent, one of the best, can\\'t go wrong with this card, class 10 is necessary and shows noticeable but not significant improvements over class 4 I bought the 64GB MicroSD card at Best Buy because I needed one for my Microsoft Surface Pro. It provides all the space I need and for people who need a lot of space (videos, Quick Books, picture editing, games, etc.) this card is the one for you. If you don\\'t need that much space, consider buying one for cheaper with a little less memory.NOTE: Be aware that this is a MicroSDXC format card. While most new computers support this format, many of the older computers do not (This includes all but a few tablets and smartphones). Before buying this, MAKE SURE your computer, tablet, or smartphone is compatible. If it is not, it will not work, period. For others who claim that the card doesn\\'t work no matter what they try, chances are their machine cannot support MicroSDXC format. I got this because I just couldn\\'t pass up the deal, $17.99. It has been incredibly fast in my HTC Sensation 4g. Pictures are taken and saved instantaneously. Only had it a few days, but have been very happy. Shipping was fast and the packaging was easy to open which is always great in my book. Only issue I had was I had to format it on my computer first before my phone was able to recognize it. You get a lot of storage at a small price. the micro sd with adapter, class 10 so it\\'s fast . I am happy with this purchase and You will be too. I hope this review is helpful! The Ultra micro SDHC was fine once I got it working. Neither the packaging nor the Sansa Clip player inform the user that the player needs to be totally off before the microcard is inserted. If not, the unit will not read the card!  Otherwise? Love it and the storage for even 16 GB, let alone 32, is tremendous... I upgraded to this after the price dropped. I originally had a 16gig sandisk card and it was in my mytouch 4g. I found toward my mytouch 4g\\'s end of life that space is running low. So when I got my Galaxy S3 I bought this card. It works flawlessly. I highly recommend it. Now errors what so ever. Super fast transfer rate. This item was priced right and fit right into my cell phone without any issues. Does what it is suppose to do and I don\\'t know what else I could say. Being a class 10 it is suppose to be plenty fast for cell phone use which I am sure speeds up camera use to some degree. Has worked well and the shipping was fast. I got this memory card for my Samsung Galaxy S3. I was running out of room on my Sandisk 32gb Class 4 micro sd card. I also wanted a faster and more durable card. I was hopping to put lots of media on it. In addition to nandroid backups and custom roms. I later found out that since this card is formatted in ex-fat it would not work to make nandroid backups or flash custom roms. Most custom recovery and custom roms dont work with ex-fat. So my only choice was to format the card to fat 32, which meant I couldn\\'t put any files larger than 4gb on it. Besides that this card is great and very reasonable price of $50. If your some one who doesn\\'t root their phone or put custom roms, nandroid backups or put files larger than 4gb than this will not affect you. This memory card is fast and provides the most storage you can put on your mobile device at this time. The card is also water proof, shock proof and comes with lifetime warranty. Ive never had any issues with sandisk memory cards or usb flash drives. They last a really long time. Using the included adaptor on my MacBook Pro to transfer files, I was impressed with the speed of this card. Got this to store movies and music on my Samsung Note III.Not much to say about a memory card except that it works as expected. I purchased this version to expand memory on my 16gb android tablet.  Nothing fancy but it does the job.  No problems and it played back flawlessly all the files I transferred.There are so many different microSD cards out now but if you see this on sale then you might want to consider it instead of cheaper no-name brand. I\\'ve ordered other SD cards before but this one is the best overall. Shipping was excellent fast and reliable. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quality product. Thanks again! I use this for my phone and it works just as it should and it was totally worth the money! Great place to store pictures and music for phones instead of using the phone memory so it will still run fast. I bought two of these one for Asus infinity and one for Samsung galaxy s3 international version. It worked fine with my Asus but it didn\\'t work on my phone. I formatted this card using the phone,the tablet and my laptop  but didn\\'t work I did some tests with apps using some apps nothing showed its not working the only way I got it to work is by formatting it in my Canon SLR camera. It works but the actual R/W speeds are 18/8 MB/s, not even Class 10. It should be marketed as \"Sandisk Basic\", not Sandisk Ultra\", unless they mean ultra slow. Now is 2014 and there is no excuse for such slow card from Sandisk.*** UPDATE ***I have redone the test with NotePro 12.2\" instead of using non UHS-I PC and the latest results are 32/8.6MB/s. Since the read speed hits 30, I believe the device is DHS-I ready. Still underwhelmed by the write speed though. SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter...SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter...Works fine. Great for adding a ton of storage to your smartphone or other device.  Fast enough for most needs and the price is right. You can\\'t possibly go wrong with a San Disc product!  Although I purchased this for my son, I have used San Disc in the past and have never been disappointed! Does it\\'s job and fairly cheap for what it\\'s worth. I had to return my first one and exchange it for another because the first one was defective. Sandisk really needs to do better quality assurance on their products. The second one works perfectly fine. I use it for my GoPro camera. I bought this for my son\\'s tablet for cartoon videos, movies and &#34;all&#34; games he will be downloading (He\\'s under 5 yrs so they\\'ll be small simple games). I bought this for a friend of mine to put some videos on it.  Initially, when plugged into the computer, we couldn\\'t find the storage in the directory.  However, after finding a micro sd to usb adapter...bingo!  Worked like a charm after that.  Install the videos, plugged the card in the phone, and we were off to the races.Not sure if we needed the adapter, but we couldn\\'t get the computer to recognize it.  We also used a Linux O/S.  Go figure. The Sandisk Ultra 64GB Micro Card is a great addition to maximize the Samsung Galaxy IIIS, whatever version you got 16GB or 32GB. Is a very fast memory at a great price. Plenty space for pictures, videos and Android Applications. Good for the 1080 videos that the Galaxy IIIS use. Super Fast. If you got the most advanced smartphone in the market as I do, this is the memory to get at the right price. I installed this on my Samsung tablet tab 2 7.0. There is definitely a performance difference on my tablet especially when i load up all my apps. This memory works in Samsung Smartphones .It is a fast memorySandisk is the most reliable memories in the market Love it, good quality good performance, great brand. Could not find better product for my money. Using it for a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini with zero complications. This product arrived in two days (Prime), it was exactly what I ordered and it works great in my Galaxy S3. I know a class 10 is not exactly needed in a cell phone but it cannot hurt, right? I\\'m very happy with this purchase. I expanded my Samsung Tab 10.1 tablet from 1GB to 32GB works fast and don\\'t see any lags. I can now store more than ten movies on my tab and play right of the flash disc with no problems.Very happy with this card. Update: providing an update with regard to SanDisk support.I bought the memory card in Aug 2012 (see original review below). In May of 2013 while on my cruise to Alaska the card went bad. During the sailing out of San Francisco it was fine as I used it to take a panorama shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. For most of the cruise I was using my DSLR but the next time I wanted to use my cell phone, the phone told me I had no memory card loaded.  Any way, tested the card on my laptop when I got back and it couldn\\'t recognize it. I contacted SanDisk via email and provide them copy of my receipt from Amazon along with the serial number on the back of the card (very hard to read) and no problems; they told me to send them back the card and they sent me a brand new card which is now still functioning in my cell phone.  Great support provide by SanDisk. No hassle as long as you can provide proof of purchase (easy to do since Amazon keeps my entire purchase history/invoices online).  One reason I buy directly from Amazon itself vs other vendors (either on Amazon or elsewhere on the Internet) is that I have confidence that the memory cards sold by Amazon itself are genuine.  there may be incredible deals elsewhere on the internet but in some cases the deals are too good to be true and counterfeit cards are being sold.Original review:Just received this today. Removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) and powered the unit back up and the storage was available.  No formatting required. Worked the first time out. Settings showed 29.71GB of total space (32GB version) and 29.71GB of free space.  I like the fact that a SD adapter came with it.  Should I ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy. (yes I can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if I ever swap this 32GB card out of my phone and replace it with a 64GB version, I can use this 32GB version via the adapter for other purposes.) Still don\\'t feel is very fast or is just my phone, I guess I will need to remove it and run some R/W tests. Still Its ok. I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn\\'t work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk\\'s card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro\\'s forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk\\'s card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn\\'t have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk\\'s website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it\\'s interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.  Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes/sec)So, 10 MB/s and all is good? Right? Wrong! iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this:$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s123.11 76 9.12116.61 185 21.04122.94 49 5.88128.00 41 5.12128.00 89 11.11128.00 134 16.73128.00 69 8.61128.00 61 7.62128.00 99 12.36[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]IMO, the last column should never dip under 10MB/s for card labeled class-10.For comparison, same test run against Samsung Pro 64GB micro-SD card:$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 52.869111 secs (20309436 bytes/sec)$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s125.30 138 16.86117.73 157 18.03123.04 150 18.00128.00 159 19.86128.00 156 19.47126.45 160 19.73128.00 150 18.72128.00 154 19.22128.00 153 19.11[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]So, Samsung is on average 2x faster, but more importantly it\\'s speed is much more constant.  And critically important, it never dips under 10MB/s. What else to say about this Sandisk Ultra 64 GB micro SD XC ? just perfect as all Sandisk cards My husband and I bought this for our GoPro and we used to to record our vacation to Mexico. We still have more than half of the space left! This item is what it is; I\\'ve been using it for a few months now and it records HD videos in my GoPro Hero3 without problems. This is my third purchase. I own 4 of them and they\\'ve been working fine so far. I have them installed on my smart phone, cameras and even used as a portable storage device and I have not noticed any issues with them. Very good product. i love this little guy its super fast and it has a lot of space for storage, just plug it in and enjoy Bought it for my gopro hero3 camera (silver edition).Working without any problems. Fast!Was pleasantly surprised of the good quality Memory Card Adapter! Now can turn it into my laptop directly. It is a great addition to a smart phone with huge capacity to store data. Also it is pretty fast to record video, no lag at all during recording. The micro SD card was very well made it had great read and write speeds and it added gray amount of memory to my Samsung galaxy s4. Really recommend this I bought this item to use in my gopro hero 3 because it\\'s what they sell on the gopro website, but can be had a lot cheaper on Amazon.  Have yet to have problems with the card. Works perfectly and for a fair price, it is immediately recognized by any device you use it . Good purchase! Needs little to no formatting and I have yet to see a SanDisk fail. Don\\'t cut corners, almost every other brand of SD cards will fail on you except these (tried numerous brands with my devices).Just remember it takes a bit for devices to buffer the information off of the SD card and static can corrupt any SD card which is usually easily fixed with a formatting. Always back up your documents to a PC/Mac as soon as possible.Oh, and if you create playlists, slideshows, etc. on devices and remove the SD card, the device will not be smart enough to re-compile it after you put the SD card back in and you will end up with blank playlists even though you have the songs so WATCH OUT!Lastly if this SD card doesn\\'t work for you for whatever reason google SD card formatting and it should help you out. These 64GB versions don\\'t seem to have formatting issues like the 32GB ones do but even then formatting to FAT32 fixes it. SanDisk is a company you can trust and offering such a good product at a low price.Comes with an adapter and small case to get full sd card size and keep it from getting lost when not in use. Appears to be Class 10, holds about as much as it says it does, came with an SD card adapter and they even gave me the option to forgo those ridiculous plastic packages that you all know and hate. The ones that the scissors refuse to cut and you just end up hurting yourself a few times before getting it open. Completely as advertised. I bought this card for my Gopro hero3+ and it was worked fine. Some people said they have problems with the cards in the new gopros but I have had no such problems. The micro card works with anything that also takes standard cards due to the included adapter. Have always had good experiences with SanDisk products.  This was priced well.  I have installed it in my wife\\'s cell phone and it was immediately  recognized.  Not quite sure about the features this chip is supposed to have but for the amount of memory it was a good deal - extra features or not. Comes with a nice little adapter for your MicroSDHC so you can use it as a normal size SD card also. pretty neat.Considering for the price at 24$ for 32gb is pretty reasonable class 10 is fast for any HD 1080p video recording or DSLR camera.I bought this for myself to use with the GoPro 3. Taking picture & Videos working great as it didn\\'t give anycorrupted files videos & pictures yet. Its working pretty good. San-disk is a pretty reliable brand as you won\\'t be able to go wrong with it. Great value, plenty of storage for both my phone & tablet!  I looked around and this is a really good deal. Shipped fast and worked really well!  I use this just in case I have to take a lot of photos! Loads fast! I have an old SanDisk SD card that still works. I thought their new cards would be just as reliable, but I was wrong.The microsd card failed yesterday inside my phone. I used the adapter to connect it to my computer, but it wouldn\\'t mount.I bought this directly from Amazon and not a third party vendor, so I know it\\'s genuine SanDisk. Best price anywhere!!! I bought this memory card for my Samsung Note 10.1. i amis really happy about it and i am recommending this product & am very pleased about it. Shipping was fast , the product has a great quality and a great pricing.I like this manufacture and I am going to order them for my other devices.Lots of space So far so good. I bought a samsung micro sd card from bestbuy and it somehow erasedeverything. So this is my second one. Hopefully it keeps all of my stuff still have 26 gb left came in HARD CASE  FORE PROTECTION I\\'m using this SD card in my Samsung Galaxy S3 instead of another one I bought with the same manufacture \"SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP\" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007KFXIDE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1).It\\'s working perfectly since October 2012. Used it in my Galaxy Note 2 for the past 16 months. All the sudden it is no longer writable. I tried many ways to reformat the card. Even Windows says format successful but all files remain after I remove and re-insert the card. Since I have private files in the card I\\'m not able to delete. I do not want to sent it back to SanDisk for replacement. Usual SanDisk quality worked as expected and delivered on time, no problems worked great on my Android Samsung Tablet. Put in the lumix camera and it works fast and great, no complaints, never had any issues, highly recommended, this brand always comes through  . Great product with enough capacity and it delivers performance. I am happy with this product on my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. Got this because you can\\'t beat the price and Sandisk has so far always been reliable for me.  I own two 32gb UHS-1 cards and a few older (16gb, 8gb, class 4, class 6, etc) Sandisk MicroSDs not including my standard SDs or my USB thumb drives and they have stood up to my tests with only one card I can think of failing, which I was still able to recover all the data from (just not write to it anymore) and I\\'m pretty hard on my rewritable media.  What more can you say? Great memory card.  Using this along with out Roku3.  Works great.  Fast transfer rate, good capacity, and reasonable price.  What else could you ask for? Cannot go wrong with SanDisk and to date it works as advertised. The price wasn\\'t a great cost savings but because it came from Amazon which has a great reputation to date as far as I am concerned, I purchased through them. Awesome card.. glad to be able to use it with my DSLR! Great storage size. Being the first adopter when it came out. Thought the sale price $119 is excellent. Got duped. It\\'s been the same price since it was first introduced. Great for the action cam. Battery ran out before it ran out of memory. No problem with storage and speed. I only had some difficulties to insert it in my card Kingston reader: http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Flash-Memory-Reader-FCR-HS219/dp/B00109Y2DQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1356544341&sr=8-1&keywords=card+reader I believ due to a sticker covering something in one of the sides. Other microSD do not have this kind of problem with that reader. Replaced one that crapped out in my tablet - taking most of my apps and a few hours of my time with it. I bought this as a gift for the hubby and he seems quite well happy with it. It hasn\\'t given him any issues, and he certainly uses a lot of information/media on his smartphone since he is a techie lol does exactly what I needed it to do for Galaxy S5. Word of Warning...With KitKat it prevents apps from editing, changing, deleting anything on your SD card. Stock Apps that come with the phone can but downloaded ones are not able to. The trick if you have pics movies or whatever is to copy them to the Phones Internal Storage and delete from there. Until they fix it or come up with a non root work around for the Operating System. Worked great in my galaxy s4--until it didn\\'t work at all for some unknown reason. Used it for about 4 months before it crapped out. BACK UP YOUR DATA WITH ALL THESE THINGS, THOUGH.... We use these in both our cameras when we are traveling. With the 32 GB we do not have to take a bunch of accessories. We also use them in our Cell Phones. Enough storage to my DSLR.Really low price for a Class 10 card.U can use several of this and make a Linux based SSD. it is handy. 64gb is a good size. even though many devices claim only to support up to 32 gb card, many of them actually do support 64g card.i like sandisk, it is a brand you can always trust (not saying they dont have lemon,but it\\'s happened to everything). I bought this for my Raspberry Pi.  It is large enough to run a full LAMP server.  The price / speed are a good bargain. it is very good, thanks SanDisk,you must have it with gopro cam to get the benefit of cam, yap. I use this for a Raspberry Pi, in the SD adapter, and it works so far.Also appeared to be the genuine part, although the prolific Sandisk counterfeiters have gotten really sneaky in recent years.I like getting MicroSDHC cards because they can be adapted to different device sizes.  For example, let\\'s say I buy a used phone or e-reader that needs a memory card, and I\\'m not using my Pi -- I can just take the Pi\\'s card, take it out of the adapter, and put it in the other device, rather than pay more money and wait a week for delivery of a new one. Just popped it in and moved some apps to the card and works great.  Video is handled quickly and all apps start fast. This is a great buy. It work just fine and I use it everyday in my cell phone. The adapter is great when moving files from my computer to my cell phone. Will buy again if the opportunity presents itself. oh how I have waited for this...works in S3 Samsung Galaxyworks in Note 3 Samsungexcellent transfer rates close to rated speeds (25mbs achieved)using this to make a music collection truly portable  (so nice to not have to carry 2 devices anymore)hope this review helps This Micro SD card is perfect for any smartphone user looking to expand the storage on their device. I personally am using one in my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Works like a charm. It is adequately fast, cheap, and fairly reliable. If you are looking for extremely fast speeds however, you should consider the SanDisk Extreme series which are the fastest MicroSD cards in the world. My card came with an adapter that this card plugs into and it becomes a full sized SD card. If you are looking to use this in a camera or any other device that uses SD cards, please look elsewhere. These cards are not nearly as fast as the full sized SD cards used in cameras. The adapter should only be used for transporting data from the phone or other device, to a computer. All in all, these are a great buy for any smartphone user looking for a higher storage capacity. The price fluctuates often, so catch em while there cheep! I got mine for around $30. I bought this on August of 2013.  As of April 2014 the card stopped functioning.  It can still be read, but the writing capability is gone.  That\\'s less than one year.  I\\'m extremely disappointed in the longevity of this card.  My usage of it has been on my Galaxy S4.  I have about 40Gb of data in it.  Guess I\\'m going to have to look for another card that has a longer lifespan than this one. Why would you get anything less?  64GB of instantaneous movies, video, music or pictures.  If you have an Android phone that\\'s capable of accepting micro SD cards go ahead and get you one or two. I originally bought an off-brand card for my new GS4 because the price seemed so good. Then, the day after I took a lot of pictures...they all mysteriously vanished :\\'(So, since I\\'ve had only good experiences with SanDisk in the past, I immediately found this card (which I was happy was on sale at the time) and bought it. I\\'ve had absolutely no problems and I expect it to continue working for a long time *knock on wood*BOTTOM LINEThis is a quality product. DON\\'T buy cards without a respectable brand name. I routinely use SDXC cards up to 128GB, and this card was unreadable on arrival.  Both of my PCs said it needed to be formatted, and as a last resort I let one of them try (Windows 7/i7with up-to-date SDXC drivers), and it could not format it.  It\\'s on its way back to Amazon.  I\\'m glad their returns are so easy! Always good, what else can I say ? Works as expected.  Based on price and performance this may be a best of breed product.  I have found the SanDisk brand to be dependable. It is a memory card, fast as any other class10 card, and SanDisk units rarely lose data.  I wish these guys would keep their marketing on the backside leaving some white space on top so we could write things.  The cheapo-brands do this but not the big guys - idiots. So this product is a large disappointment...bought it to use in my tablet but the card is forever getting corrupted....I\\'ve reformatted the card a few times but it\\'s to the point now that even a reformat doesn\\'t work..  Wasted money...don\\'t recommend purchasing. My first card ordered was bad - my tablet and my computer wouldn\\'t write to it, wouldn\\'t read it. Amazon replaced it immediately and my new card is perfect. Reads and writes very fast, much faster than the HC in my phone. I\\'m glad I got the HC 1 for my tablet. I purchased this and could not get it to work. Then I discovered that SanDisk has an app for it. So if you are stressing over this not working in your android device no worries go get the app it will work. As usual anything from San Dish is a quality product.  Bought to use with my Surface Pro.  Works as described and fast connection. I purchased 2 of these and am very happy with both. Good transfer rates. I found my last SD card caused the camera in my phone to delay when taking shots, but this one allows my phone to take pic\\'s very quickly! :) Bought this for my wife\\'s Samsung TL240, which kept locking up with a lesser speed SD card. After throwing this card in there, the camera rarely locks up when taking pictures back-to-back. If you are shooting 10+ MP and taking pictures back-to-back or shooting HD vid, it\\'s a good idea to upgrade to a Class 10 card. My Samsung Galaxy Note 2 came with 8 gigs of internal memory. I discovered that apps can only be written to the internal 8 gigs of memory so I didn\\'t want to fill up the internal memory with pictures, videos, music, etc.  I purchased the 64 GB San Disk Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 card. I found a video on youtube to learn how to insert the card since I could find nothing on it in the phone\\'s user guide.  It\\'s real easy. Turn the Note phone off. Remove the Note\\'s back plate. You see a plaque saying SD card in the upper left quadrant of the phone. Simply place the microsd card face up with the metallic pins facing down and towards the right into the depressed slot area to the left of the SD card plaque. Then slowly and gently slide the microsd card under the plaque until it clicks. If it isn\\'t in correctly, it will tend to move back out from under the plaque. Do not force. Replace the back plate on the phone. Turn the phone on.  Go to settings, storage.  At the bottom of the page, you will see SD Card.  If the microsd card was inserted correctly, you will see the additional GBs of storage displayed there.  You will also see Reformat SD card and Remove SD card.  Use these settings to erase data from the microsd card, and to remove it from the phone.  Do not try to remove the microsd card from the phone without first activating the Remove SD Card setting.  You can damage the card and the phone.  The card came quickly and San Disk is a reliable brand. It\\'s great to have the Class 10 rating too. 64GB...delivered fast and installed quick! Works like it should at reasonable price. I only wish I could get more memory in my Note 3...so much media!! Absolutely great product, will recommend. Great price. Used it on Note 10.1 and Note 2 phone. If you download a lot of music and movies, a must have. a fast memory card with room to spare at an amazing price. Suitable for Lots of Smart Phone Movies Fastest storage available today IMHO! Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  It works well with my camera using its standard size adapter and then is readable by my Note 8.  Seems quick enough for my Canon G12.  I would recommend this. Big card, a lot faster than the card that came with my phone. Allows me to switch to video and take pics faster. If you are going to get a cloud storage program think about just getting a couple big cards instead makes downloading and accessing chunks of data a lot easier. Bought it for memory in the smartphone.  So far it does what it is supposed to. Remember what I save.. bought one for my GS3 phone and when I bought my wife the same got her one too.  They seem to work seamlessly.Perhaps over kill for us but cheaper per gig than smaller gig chips... Bought this for a Samsung note 2014 ed. This will give me plenty of data storage as I will be using the note to some quick picture editing Bought this for my new Samsung Galaxy S4.  It worked right away with no troubles.  Only time will tell. :) Bought this memory card as a spare for my Samsung Tab 2 10.1.  It works great, and allows me to bring extra movies, songs, and audiobooks with me to play on the tablet when I travel on vacations. Bought this to add storage to a Sansa Fuze MP3 player.The card formatted correctly and works quite smoothly with the device.I also tried it using the adapter, in my Kodak digital camera and it was recognized instantly.  Pictures were saved quickly, allowing the camera to shoot again without undue delay. Bought this to use in my 8 inch Onda tablet.  No problems or issues installing or using.  Have about three months.  Would recommend to others. Can\\'t go wrong with this class 10 card cheap and works great may have to buy another one as a spare. Fast, reliable, plenty of size for the money. I ran Sandisk memory zone on this and was reading between 22 and 29 mbps. Not quite the 30 that it is supposedly rated at, but that is with a lot of apps installed and running off of the device. Good memory card, a gift given to junior partner, after receiving very beautiful, beautiful packaging, received a big surprise, do not know how to evaluate it. Good value for the money.  This is a class ten rated card which has a fast speed and from a good manufacturer. Got it for my Note 10.1 and it\\'s great being able to pop it into my computer via the adapter to load large amounts of pictures on and then back into my tablet. Kinda wishing I got a larger capacity one. Got this for my Galxy S3 - had another brand that the phone kept losing contact with and that corrupted a few files.  Much faster transfers with this - I got the 64GB version for my  Note 10.1. As always, super-fast shipping with Amazon Prime. Great micro SD card for smartphones or other products. I wanted something with a high transfer rate so that taking HD video there would be no lag. Great price for 32gb SD card; It was delivered on time and I got it download from my previous SC card with out any problems. Great shopping for electronic stuff at Amazon. Great price for a great chip, it worked perfectly in my new smart phone.  I swapped out a 4 Gig chip with this one, and now I have lots of excess storage capacity. Great value for extra storage on cell phones. Adapter included with memory disk allows easy interface with standard computer card reader interfaces. Had to return this item, it would not fit properly into the adapter that it came with.  Return was no problem, but I am reluctant to buy another one. haven\\'t been able to use this in the capacity that I bought it, for a tablet pro, but I have used it in a usb adapter and it works well there. Have this for a action cam - works great so far.  Can\\'t wait for my zip line tour.  Was not expensive as you would think for this size of memory card. Having used SanDisk before in my photography, I of course went to them when it was time to outfit my new Samsung Galaxy S3 with an internal microSD card. I spent the extra bucks over comparably \"no name\" Micro SD cards and bought this variant. I took quite a few pictures and even transferred an album from my computer so I coud show it to friends on the go.After less than two months, the SanDisk microSD card started acting up. It was not recognized, stopped, restarted, removed itself, reinstalled itself onto the phone - erratic behavior. Here is where I should have taken it out immediately and tried to recover anything I could before things hit the fan...unfortunately I waited too long and this morning, for no other reason than I turned my phone on, the card shows up as blank. Neither my Windows PC, nor my Mac, can even detect the card and yes, i tried two different adapters, and I tried the SanDisk recovery which \"found no recoverable files\" even though I checked all file type extensions.I\\'ve apparently lost all the pictures I had on there. To top it all off, my GF\\'s cheap \"no name\" card has never had an issue in her exact same phone and keeps chugging along merrily.Paying a premium for a substandard product that fails in use after two months? No thanks. I\\'m going back to Lexar, which hasn\\'t failed me yet. I\\'m also getting rid of all my SanDisk cards for my DSLR\\'s, just in case. The fact that SanDisk is the first card thats ever failed on me, and a new card to boot, does not inspire confidence. Buy and use at your own risk. I am very disappointed in this card.  I usually don\\'t have an issue with SanDisk, but this 32GB ultra card died after two months.  Died as in, no longer recognizable by PC / Camera or any device.  Now I have to wrestle with warranty claim. I bought it because it was a great price for the capacity and rated speed. I use it for storage in my Nook HD+ I bought this card for my android based phone, soon I started getting messages that my card had been removed and or it was damaged, Tried it in my tablet same thing, and this was not the first card of this brand that I had bought that experienced this problem. Went to several online forums to see what the solution is; then someone hit upon it, it just might be a problem with this brand of cards.I bought a PNY brand micro SD card and had no problem whatsoever. I bought this card on the strength of the 64GB XDSC SanDisk in my phone right now.  It was a gift for a friend of mine and sadly it corrupted within minutes of first use.Initially it worked fine, then dead.  We checked in a laptop and Windows Disk Management screen told me it had a single 128K partition and the rest was unusable.  Outstanding.The replacement sent by Amazon (Thank you Amazon, you are always excellent) is sitting in my office right now, I should probably check it out. I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 to expand the memory. Best money I could have spent. No issues, works as it should. Fast shipping, great packaging. Worth every penny. I bought this to expand the memory on my Galaxy S4. Inexpensive, easily to install, and comes with an adapter to make it a full sized SD card, the SanDisk Ultra should be at the top of your list. I had no issue using this with all of the above devices. It is still working strong and I trust SanDisk with all my gear including memory for DSLR use. Had not malfunctioned throughout many different uses and I trust this brand. Although it is more expensive as supposed to other brands, but they are worth extra in my opinion. I have a lot of music and pictures and keeping them on the card frees up storage for apps that cannot use the card.  Money well spent. I have always trusted the SANDISK brand for valuable data.  This was ordered for my tablet and again, great size and quality for the price. I have a Samsung Note II and was on the verge of having to uninstall programs when the newest version of Android came out which allowed you to move applications to the external storage.After reading the reviews I purchased this card to replace my 4G card, now I have room for all my pictures videos and tons of apps. The performance is really great from what I can tell , the pictures , videos and apps load quickly and I have not had any issues with this at all.A must have to extend your Android storage. I have this in a DROID X on Page Plus.  It works perfectly.  transfer speeds were good.  I have no complaints here. I have used many memory devices from SanDisk, as well as a couple of Sansa MP3 players. This card lives up to my expectations. It works well in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. I haven\\'t bothered with the adapter, but I have no doubt it does its job. It is nice to have it just in case I need to read the card outside the phone. I have used this for months on my Galaxy S4 with no issues and it is plenty fast to transfer content to this card. I just got a Note 3 and while 32gb is great...who wouldn\\'t want another 64gb?  This SD card does what I want it to do and I\\'m happy with it. I like things that work and I like things that work the way they\\'re sold to me and when they do I give it a great review so trust me when I say this works and you won\\'t find a faster SD card out there. I love this storage unit. I would buy again definitely. Great for pix, videos, docs, or whatever you want to store. I have  it in my ME173x. I\\'m very happy with this item.  My Android has about a 4GB memory, and so this card is ideal for increasing it.Jrroadrunner I needed this for my Samsung Galley tablet. It\\'s doing the job it was needed for. I really didn\\'t need the adapter, but most all micro SD cards come with them. I needed to get more space on the SD card in  my phone, so naturally! I turned to a product I know for its quality and attention to details.  I want to be sure my photos and other data are held in a safe place.  For the money, you cannot beat this product and I will buy again. Initially when I inserted the card into the Samsung Galaxy S3 it recognized it but it wasn\\'t able to format it correctly. After doing some research I found a free program EaseUS Partition Master [...] that will format the card into FAT 32 since Windows no longer allows you to do it by default. After formatting it into fat 32 the phone recognized the card and it works great now. I hope this helps anyone else that might run into this problem. In some situations, depending on what hardware you intend to use this card in you\\'ll need to format it in a special way using a formatting utility that doesn\\'t come native to windows.  Also, the card gets extremely hot under heavy load. Installed this in my Droid Bionic.I just backed up all my data using the included card reader adapter and the card reader slot on the laptop, and copied all data to a folder on my PC. Once done, reversed the process to my new micro sd card.Bionic recognized additional memory, some apps had to run updates, after adding card though this i don\\'t attribute to the card itself it seems likely the apps were referencing something specific with hardware maybe.After the updates programs ran as expected.I did have one issue with PowerAMP media player where all the playlists dissapeared. not sure why and havent yet researched this in the PowerAMP forums. I assume this same issue would occur with any card upgrade. In the past, I\\'ve bought lots of CF and SD cards and USB keys. Years ago, I bought brands randomly until I had a failure with a particularly high-priced brand. At the time, these critters were tres chere, so I decided to standardize on WD because I\\'d never had a failure (except for hard drives, but that\\'s a different topic).Now that the price per gig is less than I used to pay per meg, I still stick with WD because I\\'m using these cards over long periods of time and don\\'t want to lose the data.I recognize that this is anecdotal and may or may not be in line with what Consumer Reports says or others\\' experience, but by now, I\\'m a mindless fan and frequently chant \"Roll WiDe.\"Now, if only they would get rid of the anti-shoplifting packaging . . . . I purchased this card for a new Nokia Lumia 520 smart phone I recently purchased to extend the internal memory of the phone.The card works very well.I\\'d recommend this card for anyone who wants to extend their internal memory for any devise requiring a microSD. I purchased this to use with my Samsung tablet. It works perfectly and stores a lot of information. I would buy this product again. SanDisk knows how to make memory cards that last! I received the memory card in great condition and packing,.  I am very pleased with it.  I put it in an outdoor camera to video comings and goings of wild life.  Works great Is very stable and when i use this product in my samsung galaxy 7, sometimes the tablet don\\'t recongnize the memory but the problem is maybe the tablet not the memory i think it is an almost required piece for my Samsung tablet.  it was at a good buy. :-)it is easy to use, and easy to install. it\\'s a class 10 so it\\'s pretty fast.  I am using it in my HTC EVO LTE 4G phone hoping that it had UHS-1 capability.  It doesnt seem to so it\\'s just a class 10. Its like having my own personal cloud, So much storage in such a small item. This came at a great price and was in an easy to open package that made it easy to open and use right away. I ended up using it in my smartphone and when the screen cracked, I was able to back up everything to it and remove the card and put it in my laptop. It works as Expected. No problems installing or anything. It fits my Samsung S4. It shipped really fast and was in packaging that I could open without the use of something sharp. I use this in my Galaxy Note 3 and seems to work just fine.  I love having lots of memory and the price was good. I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Note II. For the money, it\\'s a fantastic value. I haven\\'t noticed any transfer speed issues, and it\\'s been rock-solid reliable for the 3 months I\\'ve owned it. I have about 32GB of music stored on it, and every app that can use SD card storage is set to do so, including all my system backups. The ultimate &#34;install and forget&#34; add-on for your phone! I\\'ve had this card for some time now and I\\'ve only had one problem with it and I believe that problem to be with my phone. The card\\'s formatting became corrupted and while I could still copy to and from using my computer, my phone didn\\'t recognize the card. Copying the data off, formatting the card, and copying the data back onto it fixed the issue. It\\'s really nice to have 64GB\\'s of extra data storage on my phone. I\\'ve purchased this MicroSD card back in January for use in my tablet and my Android smartphone.  I\\'ve used this card extensively to transfer music and files and I\\'ve found it\\'s rather interchangeable and versatile across a number of surfaces.  The card hasn\\'t corrupted itself or become unusable at any point so I figure, for the value, that\\'s pretty much what I want.  And 32 GB covers the amount of storage I would want for my mobile devices. I\\'ve used this card for about 3 months now and have not had a bit of trouble.  I notice to delay while the phone writes to the memory after taking pictures or shooting full HD video. I wasn\\'t absolutely certain if this would work in my Samsung Galaxy SIII (an SGH-I747M) from a regional carrier here in Alaska.I read several reviews, but took a chance the 64GB card would work in my device and was pleased when it arrived.Opting for the &#34;Frustration Free Package&#34; it was a very simple matter to open the little cardboard envelop to retrieve the contents.  A side note here, I do appreciate the Amazon packaging for items such as this, where a clamshell type of container adds no value...The card is well made and seems a quality product.  Installed the card and it was recognized instantly on boot.  The full capacitywas recognized.Maybe I am old school when it comes to memory cards, but I always format them in the device I intend on using them (at least initially.)  In this case, there were no issues.While I haven\\'t scientifically measured read / write speeds of the card, performance is respectable.  I have suffered no issuesrelated to the operation of the card.I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for this capacity and your device will accept the MicroSDXC format.  To that end, several friends have purchased (and been satisfied) with this memory card in their devices. I will keep it short and sweet for potential buyers looking for facts and not b.s.I own two of the 32gb size of these cards for about 3 months now. They do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets, yet not so good with cameras, in fact these cards failed to work with my GoPro Hero3 camera and the customer service rep from Gopro claimed (and I happen to agree with him) that this card is not a true class 10 card let alone UHS-1.Benchmarks with my evo 4g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond 8mb/s while read speeds wondered around 25mb/s far below advertised speeds, well write speeds arent technically advertised (probably because they are of class 4 level)Benchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower (due to adapter) with write speeds around 6mb/s while read speeds wondered around 20mb/s.Needless to say, if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage, these are perfect. If you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however, I suggest you not to loose your money on this, because even if your write speeds are around 10mb/s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless.Again this review is based on GoPro camera and high definition raw recording.. For cell phones or for storage it works perfectly well with a bit of false advertisement.. Just what I needed for my digital music collection on my phone. Memory either works or not what more can be said than it works as designed.  I was very happy with the price. More than a year in and still going strong. It boosts the memory of the tablet so I can store movies for trips and the tablet stores big files there automatically to save it\\'s own brain for more important things. No complaints.  Worked in every piece of electronics I\\'ve tried them in.  I\\'ve run across fake chips online before, but these are high quality at a good price. Not as fast as advertised most of the time, actually slowed down my Note 3 when I filled it with movies leaving only about 8gb free, switched to a faster card due to that, but it could also be the phones fault. All in all it\\'s a good card with good speed and size for the money. Product supplied as described: 16GB Micro SDHC Class 10 card with Adapter. I purchased this to use in my Samsung Galaxy Tablet and it works perfectly. It is easy to identify from other micro flash cards you may have because of its red/grey color. This is a great memory solution for your stored media for any device! Product works as advertised. No issues with install or general use in my mobile phone. It doesn\\'t seem particularly snappy, but that may be more the phone than anything else. Quick little puppy, SanDisk makes nice quality stuff with one exception.The adapter that came with it to let it work in the bigger slot failed horribly after 4 days.Adapters, psh!But my Transformer likes it, treats it like a child and it fits very snugly into the latching system (a recent store bought one wiggles?!?) Replaced a smaller and slower micro SD card in my phone. I\\'ve had other brands corrupt and die in the past. I\\'ve grown to only trust SanDisk.It is faster than most other micro-SD cards, the price was right at $27. Simply put the card works well in my NOTE 3, gives me the extra space needed and to date has worked flawlessly. I upgraded from a 64GB Sandisk to the 128GB with no issues. Plenty of space available now in my phone and I can keep movies and music local. Some people have scoffed online about using such a large card but the reality of it is that you don\\'t always have data service and when that time comes, such as when you\\'re on a plane, its nice to have access to some movies and music that you\\'ve kept on local storage.So far its worked in my NOTE 3 and SG4. So I\\'m not going to pretend to be an expert on sd cards, but I still like this one. It is relatively inexpensive, works wonderfully for the movies I want to store and watch on my samsung galaxy tab 7 2.0, and I haven\\'t had a single problem with storage yet. Still working with no problems so far, so it seems to be reliable. Not sure what else to say, but they want more words. The card arrived promptly and has worked flawlessly in a dashcam. Would recommend purchase to others if they need this kind of card. The card looks good, works fine, I didn\\'t do too much test with it.My only complaint until now is the package, there\\'s a line marked on the back for you to cut, I cut along the line, and nothing happened, no opening at all, all cardboard glued tightly. so I cut near the card, only to found I cut the supposed plastic card case/storage shell, now I took it out, and no storage case to store. Not a functional problem, but annoying. The package arrived on time, it\\'s very well packed and it\\'s got an adapter. It works perfectly with my phone, though it doesn\\'t allow a computer format, once it\\'s been on the phone, so it asks you to erase everything before you use it on a computer. So if you\\'re planning on buying this for different purposes and devices, gotta be aware of this. I just need for my phone, so I transfer files with my usb cable, that works just right. I also give it a 3 star because it says there are 64gb, but even when it\\'s totally formatted it only reaches to 60gb..sooo, I don\\'t know where my other 4 gb are...anyways, overall it\\'s working well. I do think it\\'s expensive for what it is. There really isn\\'t much to say about a micro SD card: it either works or it doesn\\'t. I bought this to install in my phone and it seems to be working fine. The fit was perfect and the performance is totally satisfactory. I\\'ve never had any trouble with SanDisk products and this will likely be no exception. It was a great value compared to places I had priced locally. The SanDisk Ultra 16GB memory card has shown no sign of not being exactly what I needed.  A good deal. This card has worked flawlessly in my phone for about three months! I had an smaller and slower card in it that this replaced. When doing pictures and video you can definitely tell the difference in write speed between a class ten and four. This chip is holding all my music and photos so they are ready to share with friends and family on my tablet. Quick response and no drop outs or lags.  Price was amazing!! This is a great SD card, it\\'s very fast and works well.  I have been using it for my GoPro with no complaints. This is a very fast microSD card compared to the class 4 speeds. It looks nice and it works. I\\'m not sure what else I can say other than that I have no problems with it and it hasn\\'t died on my yet.It\\'s been about 4 months at least now in my Samsung Galaxy S3. The S3 had a reputation for breaking sandisk sd cards for some reason and it\\'s only randomly unmounted about 3 times but easily remounted with a take out and put back in with maybe a restart on the phone to refresh some apps to see it. I think this is just because the Galaxy S3 tends to get really hot right below the sd card which might damage it a bit. I don\\'t think they put it in a good spot but that has nothing to do with the card itself so just get it if you want a nice sd card. This is the best accessory that you can buy for your smartphone! Simple explanation:1) I loaded all my HD movies onto this micro SD card, inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3, and it plays them superbly without ANY delays, as it it up to 30mb/s read speed!2) The most important reason for this being the best accessory for your phone is to think about this: The premium you pay for an iPhone 64GB is $200. The price you pay for this 64GB micro SD card is $50 (depends on Amazon\\'s pricing at the time). That means you get the same thing for $150 less, AND you can interchange your SD card between devices (if you buy a new tablet for example).No brainer.Note that it reads only at 10mb/s, so a 7GB HD movie will take about 10 - 15 minutes to load up. This is the biggest memory card I have at 32 gig.  It works fine!  I am using it on an 8 inch Dell tablet with Windows 8 and a solid state 8 gig hard drive. This is the latest version of the microSD cards Class 10. I purchased it for Asus MemoPad HD 7 tablet which I use mostly to play movies for my son. Since all of our movies are in HD I wanted to ensure I have a fast storage card so movies can play smoothly.This is also very important when taking pictures or videos. The faster the SD card is, the faster the device will process and store the picture and release the camera for the next picture.. with Android 4.2 JellyBean, Google introduced burst picture taking which allow you to long press the shutter and the camera will take several pictures in a row. This is great if you are trying to shoot something in motion. A fast SD card is essential for this feature to work properly. This is the SD card you need for your smart phone. I bought this for my S3 and been using it for over a year and it works perfect. I don\\'t think ill ever have to worry about running out of space. Plus the price on Amazon, you cant beat it. This is the second one of these SanDisk 32 GB MicroSDHC cards I have bought.  One I installed in my Samsung Galaxy S3 and this one I installed in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 - 8.0.  These are excellent options for both devices to expand storage.  One of the reasons I went with Samsung products is because you can use MicroSD cards unlike Apple iPhone products where you can\\'t. This provides plenty of storage capacity for your tablet and mobile devices - I\\'ve put this into all my cellphones and Android tablets. After twelve months of use, downloading music, videos, apps - there is plenty of room left.The class 10 version is also great for phone/tablet cameras as well for a stand alone camera (yes I still use a digital camera - so yesterday). This is a must for HD action video camera/recorder as well. The price continues to drop so it is very affordable now - unless your device can take the 64Gb version - I\\'d go with the higher capacity for video recording devices. This was the perfect addition to my Surface tablet.  It came in easy to open packaging and it worked from the moment I pout it in the Microsoft Surface tablet.  Expanded my 32 g tablet to a lot more storage for movies and music. This works on my phone and is amazing, however it seems to transfer pretty slowly.  I move a lot of music and movies on and off my phone so it can be annoying.  I\\'m not sure if my phone or this card is the weak link though.  I have Note 2.Anyways, it was cheap and it works, that is all that matters.  Buy it!!! This works perfect in my Dell Venue Pro 8. All I had to do was to reformat the card before using it. Wanted more space on my smartphone.  Works great. What else can I say. Thinking of buying another as a back-up for my stuff. We bought this to go with our new Samsung Galaxy Tab 4. Works great and allows us to add a lot of videos onto our tablet. We use these for our Samsung Galaxy 4s phones and they are amazing because I can now take a gazillion pictures! I only wish that I could separate the pictures on the memory card into folders but that is a Samsung issue, not the memory card issue. What is there to say about a sd card. It works, and it\\'s a class 10 card. The price was decent. I needed one for my android tablet, shopped around and this one seemed like the best choice. What more can you ask for ?  No errors ever detected by Android OS, and having this unit plugged into my tablet means I\\'m never without data or pictures that I want. When I first got this card, it worked perfectly in my Galaxy S3 phone.  Then, I rooted the phone and installed the Cyanogen Mod ROM to gain additional features not available from my carrier.  The card was instantly corrupted by that ROM, because it\\'s formatted with a filing system the ROM doesn\\'t support.  Fortunately there was nothing on the card I couldn\\'t replace.I ended up having to use a third-party utility to format the card with a filing system supported by both Windows and the ROM.Once properly formatted, there have been no corruption or data loss issues and the card has performed well.If you are using a stock Galaxy S3 ROM, you\\'ll have no problem at all.  You\\'ll find the card roomy and fast. Worked fine in my Samsung S4 for one year.  Then it stopped allowing writing to the card.  Would not format even on a PC or with another device.  The data is still there but cannot be erased. Worked with my Samsung Galaxy S3 perfectly. I finally have the space to take all my current digital content with me when I am on a plane. Works fine in my Sony RX100 using the provided adapter, but who would expect otherwise.  Bought the more expensive micro with adapter rather than full size SD so that I can move it to other devices that take micro SD.Prime shipping arrived in one day. Works Great!  I was running out of room on my 32GB card on my Galaxy Note 3.  This solved my problems nicely!  Now I have enough space for movies, music and photos on my device!  I don\\'t think I will be running out of space for a while! Works great, Plug & PlayLoads of room for whatever your needs are.I would not hesitate to recommend this product.Great card, Great price! Would not work in my Samsung Galaxt Tab 2 7.0 3G that I purchased it for.  But it does work fine in my Asus TF700. So I swapped the cards between them and everythings\\'s OK.  First time I\\'ve seen this with a Sandisk product. Does what it says. Hasn\\'t broken yet, and I hope it doesn\\'t break. I\\'ve had luck with this brand before. Usually get bored with the product before it breaks. My card got so hot it almost melted. Crazy! But you card somewhere else, I know I Wii! I\\'m not taking the chance of ruining one of my devices. No thanks Thus microSD card worked fine for a year in my Samsumg Note II. I mostly used it to listed to downloaded music from Spotify. It has actually failed &#34;twice&#34;. When it failed the first time (the phone couldn\\'t &#34;see&#34; that I had a card installed) I thought maybe something had merely corrupted it, so I formatted it, put it back in my phone, and re-downloaded all my playlists. It worked for two months and then failed again. I don\\'t plan to try formatting it again, I\\'ll switch to a different brand of card. Got this for the Dell Venue 8 Pro and it works perfectly. No complaints. Here are more words to complete my review. I bought this the day it came out for the great price of $119.99 and it finally showed up a month later. (I knew this going in). I put it in my Galaxy note 3 and it instantly recognized it and I was set.Speeds in my laptop via the included adapter ranged from 15-30mb read speed and about 12mb write speed. I copied an entire 64 GB card over to this one, and it took some time, but now I have double the space. I confirm this works for my note on CM10 nightly. however it did not work upon arrival. It had to be re-formatted into FAT32. I used a small program fat32format through Google. I believe other programs would work too. If storage is what you need for your tablet, then this is pretty much a no brainer as long as it supports it :) Would recommend if you have a Galaxy Note 10.1 I have this regularly plugged into my ASUS Transformer TF300T tablet as extra storage. But with the included adapter I can also plug it into my laptop. So I use it as a sort of &#34;sneaker-net&#34;, allowing me to move 30 GB of data to what ever I am using at the time. It is filled mostly with pictures and movies. The speed of this makes it convenient for transferring large amounts of data. I\\'ll be buying another one of these in the near future. I made sure to get the one in the retail packaging when ordering. It arrived next day from Amazon. I tore open the packaging and inserted the card directly into my Note 10.1. The card was picked up right away, no formatting needed. I will say, I had updated my unit to 4.1.2 first so I am unsure if the update is what made the recognition so easy. Already crammed it half full with movies and music. Plays all of them smooth with no lag or speed issues whatsoever. I think I will get another. Just got this 128GB micro SD card and put it in my Samsung Note 3, replacing a 64GB Sandisk card before. The Storage under settings show 119GB free space! It was as easy as 1-2-3.Testing it using SD card reader on my laptop, I get around 45MB/s read, and close to 30MBs write. That\\'s above the advertised throughput.So far I populated around 100GB of video files, and after a week of 3-4 hours of playing videos from the SD card, there has been absolutely no glitches, no hanging, and no errors! SanDisk continues its legacy with this high-speed microHD card. A definite must for your tablet or smartphone, provided it accepts external memory cards. Then again, why would you buy one that doesn\\'t? This micro sd card does what is supposed to do and more. My phone actually feels faster. And i got tons of storage. Works as expected.Love having more room for picture files,etc.on my Samsung galaxy tab 3.Buy this one,its just right,you wont be sorry. Received one - didn\\'t work. Not readable on my Mac or my Win 7 PC. Tried another - retail packaging and is raw format and although my Galaxy S3 sees it, it won\\'t write or format and the computers don\\'t pick it up either.Taking the other person\\'s 1 star review and trying a class 6. Can\\'t afford to lose data, not that I can write to these anyway. Both went back. I purchased this memory card for use in a Galaxy S2 smart phone.  Music stored on the card plays without problems.  Works great and while not the cheapest, the price was not bad.********Update 11-28-12*********After about 1 month of use, the card failed.  After a few emails to SanDisk, they issued and RMA and promptly provided a warranty replacement.  On the whole great service.  These things are tiny and some failures are expected, so as long as this one keeps working, I still give it 5 stars. Works fine my Virgin Mobile HTC EVO V. The phone didn\\'t recognize it at first, but after formatting it\\'s all good. This Micro SD card works great in my Hero 3 Black edition. I have never had any problems with any SanDisk product that I have owned. This product was early coming in. It works great in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. It\\'s easy to upload and export items from multiple devices with the adapter that comes with it. I love this 64 GB microSD.  I dont ever have to think about it now.  I love that we can get such a large amount of memory for our devices. All the horror stories about SD memory not really being the density reported.  I loaded two of these things to the max.  All data is accessible. It\\'s worked great with my Galaxy S4 cell phone. Videos and photos taken with the phone automatically get stored to the memory card after it was installed as do may apps.  No issues. Bought this card to use with my Samsung Galaxy Tab2 7in tablet, based on others who have reported getting it to work in their Galaxy Tab 2.Bottom line, you gotta reformat this card as FAT32 with 32kb sectors to work in the Galaxy Tab 2, and that requires jumping thru some hoops as Win6/Vista does not even offer the choice to format as FAT32, only as NTFS or exFAT, neither of which will work with the Galaxy Tab 2 (Android v4.04)  You have to use 3rd party software to accomplish this.  A FREE solution is the EaseUS Partition Master free software you can download from cnet or direct from EaseUS.  I had a commercial package already installed (Acronis DiskDirector) that I used.Once fomatted as FAT32 with 32kb sectors, the card is recognized AND all the space is seen and useable.Highly recommended if you need the space.  I would assume that this would also make LARGER microSDXC cards work as wellJohn I got this for my cell phone and it was easy to put in. I have had not problems with it at all, it\\'s been in my phone for a few months now and it\\'s great having all the extra storage for pictures. I got it on time and it was so easy to remove from the package. If your card gets hot enough to be painful, it is defective and you need to contact SanDisk!From my experience, the larger micro SDs run hot on format and writing, but not to the pain threshold!I purchased one of these cards to use in a camera and Android tablet.  Great read speed but write speed was okay.  Used card for about two weeks and then all my files disappeared!  Tried to format the card and three different computers with XP, Windows, and Linux couldn\\'t format it.  The camera and tablet couldn\\'t format it.  I RMA\\'d it and got another because SanDisk is a good brand.  I did notice that when formatting or writing the card it got hot, very hot.Second card didn\\'t last 24 hours and had the exact same symptoms as the first card.  Write a file or format it resulted in the card getting hot enough to reach the pain threshold.  I called up SanDisk and while explaining this was the second card I\\'d received with the exact same symptoms, when I mentioned it getting hot, they immediately issued me an RMA.  They said they were told to issue an RMA the moment they heard a card ran hot.Smaller SanDisk micro SD\\'s or regular SD\\'s I have or use don\\'t do this.  I think SanDisk has an issue with this card.The last 4 digits of the part number refer to the date code and origin of the card.  Both cards had different date and origin codes. Great card for a great price read and write speeds are on par with what is posted on the specifications detail report. Does not work.  I have a card purchased at Best Buy that looks identical side by side.  BUT!  Transferring music onto the Best Buy purchased card was extremely fast.  100+ meg albums transferred in 2 to 3 seconds.  On these cards, a 61 meg album was at 18 minutes remaining with less than a quarter of the album transferred.  I bought two, so I figured maybe a bad card.  Tried the other, same thing.  Extremely slow.  Wonder if they are even real. My pour Note 2 has been working absolutely overtime.  I just love it so much.  So I am downloading a great many pictures, audible books, and of mp3\\'s from Amazon.  With all of these many interest of mine working over time I soon found that the 32 GB microcard was just too small.  So when Amazon had a great sale on the 64 GB ones I purchased it.  My main concerns was would it work in my phone and be fast enough to do so seamlessly.  Well that it was this 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 did.  So whatever SanDisk wants to name it, the bottom line is that it works seamlessly and now I don\\'t get those nasty warnings telling me my memory was almost full.  It is very nice that Samsung realized the need to be able to use such larger memory cards, and the Note 2 allows this size card use without any issues at all. Gave to my Samsung galaxy note 10.1 the power to take and use it with any kind of application. Quick, easy, install and play. So far so good. I\\'ve never noticed a difference in memory cards, I\\'m just very glad to have extra memory! I replaced a 64GB card in my note 3 with this 128GB card and everything seems to be working just fine as expected.  I\\'ve been using the card for about a week. I have been amazed at memory pricing, but this little card is inexpensive, fast and just what I needed for my new tablet. Be aware--if you want to use this device to record and play high-definition video with files greater than 4gb, you\\'ll need to format the card as exFAT or NTFS (if you want to play the files on either a PC or a Mac. But it works well after properly formatting. I think this is probably a fine product, but it wasn\\'t compatible with my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. Formatted as exFAT (as it came from the factory), didn\\'t work at all, but that\\'s a known problem with the GS3. But even after reformatting to FAT32, the card caused my phone to reboot multiple times. Amazon sells this card for a great value! No local store even comes close to this price. It has plenty of room on it for lots of storage. These cards work well with many of our pieces of electronic equipment when we travel.  The price was perfect and none failed. They also worked with the readers we had. Great price on the 64GB mircoSD card... my boyfriend has had it in his Galaxy note 2 for the past few months.. and I just got a note 2 and just bought another one for my phone!  :) Lots of capacity, no problems with loading it up, and no issues with corruption.  Transfers and access are fast and you really can\\'t beat the price for a name-brand card.Not much more to say... it\\'s a memory card that works :-) Memory cards are almost commodity items now, but I still prefer name brands with 5+ year warranties.  Had a problem with a Sandisk a while back, and they replaced it under warranty without any hassle. I have two of these and use them for my Galazy Note 2. It\\'s great having the flexibility to keep extra storage with you for your \\'phablet\\'.So far they have done what they are intended to do. can\\'t say enough about it ... just works perfectly every time ... wish I could say the same about people ... great product When I placed this in my Galaxy S4 phone it read it right away at 29.7 GB. Which is expected to loose a few GB. I transferred file from my old card and it was done fast. Although I didn\\'t have large files to start with. I had been looking for a large card and this one fits the bill. The other reviews helped sway my choice. I would recommend this card, so far no issues. This itty, bitty SD card packs a whole lot of punch!When I saw how small this was, I was blown away.65GB in something the size of my pinkey fingernail, AMAZING!I have used it on my camera and my phone.I would highly recommend this to anyone. This works perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 new cell phone, greatly expanding memory. It installs very quickly and easily. easily excellent product.  great storage capacity.  super fast.  delivery was excellent as alwaysPros =- everythingcons: noneputting in more so I make 20 words. not much to say, it\\'s a perfect product.  exactly what it says it is Adding this unit to my Galaxy S III gave me a hand held that was faster, powerful, and had more storage space than my first NEW PC purchase in 1991.  Dig it! What can I say.  I got this at a one day sale only on Amazon and wow this things worked smoothly. No errors, no formatting needed. I just popped it into my GSIII and it worked like a charm It works good with my phone.  Very fast when it is used.  Camera seems to work better.  Thanks for the deal. A few months ago I purchased a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Note. It was my very first tablet. I didn\\'t know much about them, a friend told me I need one. I couldn\\'t do without it now. I was having issues with the storage, and was told I needed a SD card, and this was the one I was recommended because it had the most storage.I managed to put the in myself after watching a video on YouTube. My friend told me to downloaded App manager from Play Store, which I did and after clicking on App manager to open it, I successfully transferred all my Apps to the SD card. I checked in settings, now I\\'m happy because I have tons of room for other things.I\\'ve had it a couple of weeks now, even though I\\'ve added several more Apps and my bookmarks etc, I still have no storage problems. I was told that this card is the best, I have no complaints, it\\'s doing a great job. I\\'m glad I didn\\'t go for a cheaper version. Great price. My Galaxy S3 recognized it no problem. This replaced my old 16 GB micro sd card. Thank you Amazon! It installed and is working without any problems in my Samsung Note 2.  Price was  very good for the price. Works well in my Droid RAZR MAX. Allows plentry of space to move videos & pictures to card for later transfer to computer. I bought this card so I could have some storage that was quick.  This card delivered.  That\\'s about all there is to say. I got this card for my phone. I was expecting a significant increase in speed. I have not really noticed any great speed improvements. The card is working great with no problems. Just get a slower card for your phone, you won\\'t notice the difference. I really like the performance.  Since I put it into a USB 3.0 adapter, I get about 27MB/s actual measured throughput. SanDisk is the best brand. This chip does exactly what it should do and does it at very good speed. My Samsung Galaxy Note 2 loves this chip. I have always been pleased with the SanDisk products and this one is no exception. It works as advertised. I would purchase it again. A must have for those who have android products with expandable memory slots...the go to place to save your pictures and videos so if you change phones or tablets you won\\'t lose your memories. I just popped it in my Sony Xperia Tablet Z .  It works.  There is no sense that I will ever run out of room.  If I was using it for work that might be different, but I could just change with a new micro sd card.  I don\\'t know why all tablets don\\'t have a port for one.  I feel confident with the SanDisk brand.  I have never bought a bad SanDisk product. I just bought two of these for our two new Samsung Galaxy IV smart phones.  The adapters will make it possible for the card readers on our computers to accept these MicroSD cards if we find it worthwhile to pull them out of the phone case rather than use the USB &#34;dongle&#34; to move information on and off the phones, but.. most importantly, now I don\\'t worry about storing audio books, favorite playlists, and video clips I might want to show someone on the phones. Card is Good. I ordered one before and it performs as one would expect, so I ordered another. It took much longer to attempt get the second one so I wrote and got a refund. Seller, NMicro Technology,  was not the same as the first. 14000 reviews and counting !! Do you need any other justification to buy this one if you are looking for a microSD card?? Add to it the reliable name of SanDisk and you are left with no doubts to buy this or not!!! Also its available at almost half the actual price with Amazon (I did check the price at local sellers and no one is selling it that cheaper).Comes with a decent writing speed (good for most shooting/recording devices) and has a very very long warranty (10 years !!!). The technology may take a leap before this one stops functioning on you.Want to use it as a SD card in your camera? No problem. It comes with an adapter with which it can be used in any device that uses a SD card. That makes in two-in-one card!!!!! I join the long list of customers who have had their SanDisk die on them.  Customer service from SanDisk has been helpful.  They pay for UPS shipping for the return and promise a 7-10 day turn around once the defective disk has been returned.  Still it\\'s a pain to deal with and I lost some photographs.UPDATE: SanDisk sent me a replacement and it seems to be working.  If the replacement goes bad, I\\'ll be back to complain:)SECOND UPDATE: All is well with the replacement so I\\'m giving it three stars. Got a Samsung Galaxy note 2 7.0 I\\'m gonna use for a CarPC and found that you could install a 64gb microSD. Tried this one and it worked flawlessly. Pretty zippy too for a tablet (ugh....tablets read/write is stupid slow but just good enough for media I suppose)Plugged this thing right in and used the tablet to format it. Got 60gb out of it. Good good. the unit shows 0 bytes, in a PC or the phone. it keeps dismounting also. I got a replacement and it did the same thing. Not sure what is going on but it looks like a Chinese counterfeit case. I have seen this happen more and more lately. Amazon seems to be a major portal for these hings, it makes sense with a such a large retailer, they cant check everything. I do not get the advertised speed of 30MB/s, more like a 200-300KB/s on my Galaxy S4. At least it gives me a lot of extra storage space, for a phone it works nicely if you don\\'t need to transfer big files. I originally bought a Samsung equivalent and then my phone was stolen, so I made the switch.  I have done some research and realized the class 10 and the SDXC are very important as it is the quickest rate of transfer.  However when you read Samsung\\'s description and this one, Samsung claims 80 mbps and SanDisk has 30 mbps, after using both they are identical.  The class and the sdxc are the most important, they are almost absolutely identical.  Samsung\\'s equivalent is $65 and this was under $50.  I haven\\'t noticed a bit of difference, besides that maybe this mircosd card is a bit quicker and easier to move files around.  I store a lot on my phone, which is a Samsung Note 3, this works beautifully. I own MULTIPLE of these cards for my phones and devices and haven\\'t ever had a problem.  Would buy again if I ever needed one for another device. It is so hard to imagine that you can have 32 GB is something smaller than a postage stamp, yet here it is.I bought this card to work with my Call of Duty Ghosts Tactical Camera and it works perfectly.  The camera came with a 4 G card which I filled in just over an hour at the local Kart track.  I missed the last bit of our race due to insufficient capacity.  The battery was still going strong so I needed more card for recording my adventures.This card fits the bill nicely.As a UHS Speed Class 1 (roughly equiv Class 10) card this SD card is quite capable of any photographic or video need up to Full HD (not 2k or 4k).  I use a similar card in my Canon 60D and am able to hold around 700 raw images, and a few hours of HD video.Here are some benchmarks for comparison including this card.MacBook Pro Retina SSD430 MB/s write323 MB/s readGeneric Class 6 4GB (Came with Ghost Camera)9.8 MB/s write21 MB/s readSanDisk Extreme Class 10 8GB21 MB/s write23 MB/s readThis Card San Disk Ultra UHC 112 MB/s write45 MB/s readWhat does this mean?  It means that you should have no trouble recording HD video reliably with this card.  Your camera will be able to save pictures quickly to this card so it is ready to take the next shot.  If you fill the card completely it will take roughly 12 minutes to copy all the data off of the card, assuming the device you are copying to can keep up.The tests were done in the built in SD card drive of the MacBook Pro using the included SD Card Adapter.Based on my tests, I would say that if you don\\'t really need a Micro SD, then you should buy a standard SD card, your performance might be better and the price should be lower.  However, if you think you need or might need a Micro SD down the road, this is a suitable solution. had it in my samsung tablet and it went bad after 2 months, wont let me reformat or read it or do anything with it. money down the drain. I use the card with GoPro Black Edition and it is just enough to record some action while horse riding. I have always used SanDisk as recording cards and I am happy with the quality I get. Purchased this for new Samsung S4 Active smart phone.  It worked perfectly, just installed it, no need to reformat.  I\\'ve put the amazon.com URL and description below with frustration free packing part number:SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-ASanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with AdapterB009QZH6JS I got this for the Sports-Vue 360HD action camera. It works fine. It came with a converter to standard SDHC size/format. I used that to transfer files from the video camera to my XP pro PC. It does fine. I left the card in its FAT32 format and it works without a hitch. It\\'s very small, so you must exercise care not to set it down or drop it and lose it. I\\'m happy with this item and would recommend it/purchase it again. In fact, I purchased 2. I bought this sundisk memory card for my knew cellphone and it is fantastic, it stores all my cell contacts and leave much space to store any apps or programs I want, I recommend it with all my hurt. I got this for my Galaxy S4 so I could store most of my music. It works great. Easy to install (duh), worked out of the box (good), and transfer speeds seem to be very fast. I need to get another one for my Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition. Was purchased to expand memory in a tablet.  It works well in my a tablet and can be used in a camera using the adapter. I bought this as a gift for a co worker he went from 512 megs to 32 gigs what a difference. Although it will take him a while to fill it up, he still enjoys it compared to his old one. I bought this as additional memory for my ten inches samsung tab and i happy with it and noe have more storage I got the micro sdcard 64gig, I reformated to fat32 and works very well on my galaxy s2 i9100 with no problems at all, thanks:DEDIT: After 7 months of using this memory card, now i tried to format it but it wouldn\\'t, i tried about 5 different methods and none of them worked, i wouldn\\'t recommend buying this one: SanDisk Ultra 64GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS Memory Card Speed Up To 30MB/s With Adapter, Frustration-Free Packaging - SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A. Avoid buying it or you will experience problems in half a year. Still working fine in my Galaxy SII.  No complaints.  I do have a complaint about my Galaxy occasionally erasing everything on it, but I\\'m sure that\\'s not the card\\'s fault. Works just fine installed on my new MS Surface Pro...too bad Windows 8 user experience is lacking! Delivered and works as expected from SanDisk. I got this for my Samsung Galaxy Note. After reading various reviews and comparing different micro SD cards, I decided to get this. One of the main reason was because of the speed of this card (UHS-1). The card has been good to me and I\\'m happy with my purchase. Perfect for my GoPro. The size is enough, and the speed (class 10) is what I need to have perfect records, and perfect plays. I don\\'t need the adapter, but it cames in hand for use when sharing the images with friends or backing up on my netbook. the price is good, it worked as expected, there is not much more to say about it. Have not tested the adapter. Gives you more memory for your Tablets that accept Micro SD cards.  Just that simplethis is very good quality. I purhased this thinking I was getting an amazing deal.  The price was right, the product was not.  After a few months I am unable to delete or add files, pics or music to this microsd card.  I am only using 28gb of space on it.  I cannot add anything, nor delete anything, it won\\'t even allow me to format it and start fresh.  I am not happy with this product and extremely disappointed.  I use my phone a lot and store music and pictures on my phone for various purposes.  I would recommend buying another 64gb microsd card.  One that is more reliable. I have a GoPro 3 camera with which the cards (64Gb and 32Gb editions) work perfect.Formatting went perfect, movie recording and picture taking without any problem for the last 6 months now.However, I tried to use it in a Contour+ and the Contour GPS and both cameras are unable to use the cards, I presume these cards do not fit the Contour specifications (unable to format, no way to record on the card).So make sure the card is compatible for its intended use. The recommended card for GoPro cameras. That\\'s what I use it for and it works great providing outstanding performances and great quality. Love it!!  Been using this card for six-months now and it hasn\\'t failed me yet!  So far I wiped it once from use in a mp3 player to a 3ds memory card and it has performed flawlessly.  The price is actually lower now than when I first purchased so go ahead and purchase one with no regrets! I got this while it was on a deep sale here on Amazon. I couldn\\'t pass it up. It comes with an standard SD card adapter so it\\'ll work in your computer or anywhere else you can stick an SD card. It hasn\\'t had any faults and does the job. I bought this for my Microsoft Surface Pro, and it works great and is really fast. It also comes with the adapter so I can use it with my camera. I would definitely recommend it, besides its a really good price! Not much to say about his SanDisk mIcroSD card. I needed something with more storage and it serves it\\'s purpose. Does exactly what it is supposed to.  Plenty of storage for me GPS.  Price was not too high either.  Would recommend. I bought this to use in my Chromebook with a short SD card adapter.  I can transfer a 1 Gbt file from the SD card to my USB 3.0 flash drive in about a minute. I needed a bit more storage in my Galaxy Note II, this has worked perfectly.  I have not run into any problems, other than finding out that my phone does not allow moving applications to the card due to limitations that have been added to the newer versions of Android I got it for my Galaxy S4 and it works well. It has a good speed and good space which is something I definitely needed. Sometimes it has a hard time getting recognized in my computer, but I always find a way to make it work. It will not do NTFS, but its not necessary for my purposes. I put this in my Verizon Samsung Galaxy Stellar and it works perfectly. This is an easy way to add memory for pictures, music and apps, etc, to the phone I have always had good luck with SanDisk products and am pleased with this memory, reliable and looks cool too. Fast and Lots of storage, not a flimsy card either. Fells like its build tough. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Side note, if your device supports it and you can afford it, get the 64GB. Youll appreciate NEVER changing out ur card. Great SD card. I use it in a Galaxy S3, and have no complaints.Its quite fast, and works. I don\\'t know what else to say.You can\\'t go wrong with SanDisk. I am not using it to shoot continuous HD video or anything, i just wanted a fast one so it wouldn\\'t take so long to copy movies and large files onto it. It works very well for a great price. I have bought it for around 6 months. It works good so far & both read / write speed meet the described specification. I\\'m using this card in a phone and so far I have no complaints. Access to the card by the camera and other applications seems fast enough. Works well. Beware some of these SD cards are not what they say they are. This one is in my Nokia phone. Loaded maps and songs on it. No problem. Great card at a great price! Doubled the storage on my new HTC One M8 and now I\\'ve got 64 GB total storage on my phone and I have no idea what to do with it all. :PSure beats the 16 GB my iPhone 4s had!Anyway, the card works great and it\\'s speedy to boot! the micro sd works great as described. but beware that the micro sd adapters are faulty. the micro sd will get stuck in the adapter. you will have to carefully rip apart the adapter to get the micro sd out thus damaging the apapter. Purchased in November 2012 (less than 18 months ago)  for use in my then new Samsung Galaxy S3.  It has never been removed from the phone until today when it failed.  Since the phone is still fine and the memory card is stored well inside, it\\'s safe to assume this card has suffered no abuse.  Today, the card is totally unreadable.  It can\\'t be formatted by the phone.  The PC doesn\\'t see it at all.  It\\'s dead, Jim.  I\\'ll be contacting SANDISK about warranty today.UPDATE:  I\\'ve updated this from 1 start to 4 because although it failed, SANDISK is replacing it at no charge.  Sometimes stuff fails. If a manufacturer will stand by it, that speaks well.  Nice that because I bought it on Amazon I could search my orders and find the original invoice to use when I contacted them. This is just what the tablet needs, it increases the memory up to nearly 100 GB so I will bnever run out of storage space. Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Tab3. Transfer speeds are excellent with this card.I would recommend this card to everyone. Arrived in manufacturers packaging so it looked authentic. I was still sceptical based on reviews I read from others on Amazon, so I called thecustomer service phone number for San disk and they verified it was genuine. You will need a magnifying glass ro see the numbers printed on the back of the card, or alternately you can take a photo of it with your smartphone, I used the Galaxy S3 om Macro or text setting and then enlarged the photo to read the numbers.very happy with this card fast response, have hundreds of photos and songs on this card and it works great. Hold a lot of stuff for my phone! Used like 6Gigs for my music. And I have it set to use my card for photo and video. Might do movies on it... But who watches movies on a phone.... its a memory card and has the reputation you expect from SanDisk. I thankfully didn\\'t get a knock off, counterfeit, card because It was bought official threw Amazon. it works as advertized and at full capacity (59~ gigs after formatting, which is to be expected) it has good speed for things like games movies music and photos (view/shooting) I\\'ve owned it for about two weeks now and its been reliable giving me no reason to doubt it.if you have a low capacity phone/tablet/device you should buy a card and SanDisk is probably the brand you should go with. the price is rite (through Amazon) and they are backed by both the manufacturer and the distributor with a warranty (Amazon A-Z 30 day, and SanDisk- 6mo parts I think it is) its better than you can get with budget or discount cards you find elsewhere.I recommend this product to customers looking for quality storage space. Great quality product. Purchased for GoPro Hero 3 and works great with the adapter. Would recommend to anyone buying a camera with micro SD. There is not much to say about a micro-SD card, but this one seems to work for me. word, word. Performs as it is supposed to. 16gb is quite a lot of storage plus my Samsung Galaxy has 15 gb of internal memory for a total of 32 gb. That\\'s plenty enough to store hundreds of hours of music, Purchased 2 of these for my Samsung Galaxy S4 (AT&T). The cards work without any issue; storing games, movies and music on them. I would recommend to anyone and would most definitely purchase these again without hesitation. As always, a big thanks to Amazon for 2 day shipping! I was amazed at the speed of this sd card on my smart phone the HD video no longer jumps and buffers while recording and the transfer time from pc to phone has decreased dramatically I use this for a dash mounted camera for my company car. It is constantly recording and erasing old videos when the card is full. It has been used for nearly 2 years, including cold winters and hot summers, and has never messed up. For the price it was a great buy. I would recommend to all. It has a pretty high transfer rate, and comes with an adapter so you don\\'t have to worry about that. Ordered this from Amazon and was expecting it to work perfectly like my other 32GB sandisk (in my galaxy s4). However, I was really disappointed that upon placing it in my note 10.1 2014 edition the card become unrecognizable. I tried reformatting on the computer, on the phone, and yet, no prevail. It could be the firmware or current update of android, but the point is that, if other companies can make a card that works, why not do the same? Maybe I got a bad batch, who knows...I went ahead and ordered the G.Skill microsd card and now it\\'s working perfectly. I\\'m s I have this sd card for awhile now and I would have to say its awesome. The service was great. The product got to me at a reasonable time. My overall experience is 10/10. Thanks. I use this in my tablet for extra space and it works as it should. The storage space is awesome and works good i have had a few months now and not having any issues! Got this for my galaxy s3, fits well works fine. I moved all my stuff from the phone to the card and working great! Nothing much to say other than it works just fine and it has great price. Needed another one for my phone after my first one got corrupted after a systems update. Just a tip: If you phone prompts you for an update you might want to take the card out before doing so; I corrupted two cards that way. The memory card works well and I have no problem with it. It was one of the cheapest out there. Came with adapter, so that\\'s convenient. I bought a class 10 Samsung and returned it after I found out the speed was actually lower than that class. After buying and using many different brands, I have found that this company makes the fastest, highest quality, memory cards. Other companies advertise their cards as being certain classes but they are not up to par. I think $19.99 is a steal; best buy sells this product for $39.99. (As of 7-11-12)The card I recieved must have been a dud. It is broken and my phones are not able to read it. When I try to use it in the computer it says the card is damaged. I will be returning to Amazon. Works as specified, received in good condition from Amazon, using since a few months, in a smartphone, it doesn\\'t get better than this if you\\'re using Sandisk in terms of speed and space. You can expect speeds upto 28 MB/sec for WRITE, about 30MB/sec for READ, with the provided adapter, speeds ar always better for both read/write, using smartphone to read/write, speeds would be lesser mostly, but average should be 20mb/sec anyways as per what I\\'ve seen and I\\'m a heavy user, like if there is a 256GB microSDXC available, I would actually buy it, tried the Extreme version with 80mb/sec, costs 2 times of this one, but works similar to this, so dont waste money on name that doesnt deliver, buy this if you\\'re buying to Sandisk Bought a cheap tablet with no storage. This works fine and is fast. Now I have plenty of external android app storage and also videos to watch. does as promised, neat frustration free packaging, didn\\'t run any speed checks but believe in SanDisk quality which is unmatched Using this card for my GoPro Hero 3 Black.  No issues to date.  Card was used to video vacation in Palau, Yap, & Guam - underwater video.  So far, no complaints! Couldn\\'t find this in the local stores. It is what we needed and it was brand new as stated and works great. Works great with my Galaxy S4. Didn\\'t need to format the card or anything. Just popped the card in and everything worked great out of the box. Transfer speeds are excellent with this card. I would recommend this card to everyone. Easy to install and performs per specs.  I have expanded the capacity of my handheld scanner with this product.  The convenience of these micro products is phenomenal!  I began my career in IT in the 70\\'s and can attest to the truly wonderful progress tech has made over the years.  We do more with less--that\\'s innovation, that\\'s capitalism at its best! I bought this card for my Phone. It gave me the extra storage for my pictures and video that I needed. It\\'s fast and not too expensive, Still works after several months, unlike a lot of cheaper cards.  You don\\'t need this fast of a card in most phones if you just access but it makes a world of difference if you do a lot transferring. than i expected. I don\\'t know if it would kill any manufacturers to actually have a memory card or stick or device to actually HAVE Available the advertised capacity. Fortunately l learned that the advertised and actual available memory are TWO SEPARATE THINGS before i bought it, always scroll down and read the technical spec of a device or anything before you buy as that way ideally, your actually informed. Let the buyer beware, is more appropriate every day as most things are not exactly as they seem. And if it\\'s food and cheap, it\\'s likely cancer causing and don\\'t feed your body and your car in the same place. I use in a tablet.  Works perfectly.  Good size / price.  The more capacity ones will come down eventually but this is perfect right now. Since there are almost three thousands reviews already, I bet almost everything about reading and writing speeds have been covered. I\\'ll just try to provide some specifics from my experience in case if somebody is searching with these keywords. I\\'ve copied some WAV and MP3 files to this card from a fast PC (3.4 GHz, 16GB RAM, 7,200 RPM HDD, 64-bit Win 7, etc.) with a built-in card reader. The card reader maybe my bottleneck. Anyway, the observed average writing speed was around 9.5MB/s.Tried this card in Nokia 3555b. Logically this phone cannot read more than 8GB MicroSDHC cards, but it it. However, it saw the card as being only a 2GB card. Tried inMotorola Flipout Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Android Phone with Bluetooth, Camera, QWERTY Keyboard and Wi-Fi - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black. Played those WAV and MP3 files and it worked very well. Tried inMotorola MB520 Bravo Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 3MP Camera, FM Radio and GPS - US Warranty - Blackwith the same files, and it worked well too. No hiccups. Then inserted (and left it in) inBLU Studio 5.3 II Unlocked Dual Sim Phone with Dual-Core 1GHz Processor, Android 4.1, 5.3-inch IPS Capacitive Touch, and 8MP Camera - U.S. Warranty (Black). So far so good. Will update this review if problems will arise.It was sold and fulfilled by Amazon in a frustration-free packaging. I love this packaging not only because it does not have nasty blister pack that cuts your fingers, but also because it is eco-friendly. Loving it! Plenty of room to store my media and go back and forth between my pc and tablet.  Also great for storing all my school related texts and documents. Had no issues inserting this into an HP tablet and adding photos, music, etc to the memory.  Reads/writes quickly.  Great value. I put the 32 GB card in my Galaxy S3 and it is working as well as could be. I popped the SD card into the slot, went to settings-> Storage-> and selected \\'format\\'. That was it. Then I set up an Mp3 folder which was instantly recognized by double twist and now I have tons of storage for music, pics, and more. Great card. After assuming I was stuck with a number of Micro SD adapters that didn\\'t work I purchased the SanDisk Ultra card and low and behold everything started working. Even my wife\\'s tablet that didn\\'t recognize the SD cards movies started working. Bottom line it just works. This is working great in my AT&T Galaxy Note. I love having extra storage for my music videos and pictures Super fast compared to my other cards. Didn\\'t do any tests, but this is much faster than no name &#34;class 10&#34; cards. Like I said, this is a flash drive. It works. There are no data copying or writing speed problems and it performs within manufacturer specs. I\\'ve noticed something VERY CROOKED online...postage scalpers! Charging $8 bucks to mail out micro sd cards that usually come in a small envelope? I mean COME ON! The FTC needs to crack down on these postage scalpers because they are working in FULL FORCE these days?I\\'d say a Micro-SD card should mail NO HIGHER than a $1.50 to $3.00 bucks but $8.00s????These crooks ARE DEMENTED! I\\'ve just been deleting orders out of my cart & will keep doing so till I find one that WON\\'T rip me off!Great products come  from Scan Disk but BUYERS BEWARE of these shops who mark these things with high priced postage & then mail it out in a small envelope! and YES almost EVERYONE I\\'ve ever ordered came in a small envelope BTW...Shame on you! I think I\\'ll write my congressman about it! [for whatever good that\\'ll do? w/a 10% rating as they NEVER CARE what \"We The People\" want!]Never the less, You all should be fined by the FTC for committing HIGHWAY ROBBERY!  end of review & hopes this helps others speak out against highway robbery via high postage gauging! As said above I\\'ll keep browsing till I find a good store who WON\\'T commit this crime! As my dad likes to say: There\\'s no honest people anymore!ONE FINAL NOTE: Amazon & all of the other online outlets should stop allowing people to charge what they want for postage & only allow them to ship it at cost! a.k.a price figuring via what the item actually ships for at the PO,FedX &/or UPS! I recently upgraded from my trusty Droid X to the Samsung Galaxy S4.Given it\\'s hi-def videos and pictures I wanted a big and fast memory card.This faster card loads the gallery so much faster than one in the X.Otherwise, it\\'s a memory card and it works well. I have been using this in my Canon camera. it has been working well. over 6000 photos and many videos. The first few weeks after I bought this, I had some problems (like my phone can\\'t detect the micro SD card). I tried formatting or repairing the card, but no success. So I returned this to SanDisk and they willingly replaced this in a week. No more questions asked. And since then, I\\'m still using the 2nd card that I received. No problems until now. This memory works great on Surface Pro 2, no problems at all, transfer rates are acceptable. Before the Surface Pro 2\\'s firmware update, the memory was disconnecting itself, I had to take it off and put it on again, but after the firmware update, I have no problems, the memory always stay there. I put it into my phone, and now it is like my phone has unlimited storage possibilities on it. Thank you! This memory is very fast, perfect for phones, very good product I give it 5 stars and recommend it for all types of use ... This is exactly what I was looking for to upgrade the memory of my smartphone. Good transfer speeds to using SanDisk product, and great pricing from Amazon. A 32Gb micro mem card for the Samsung Galaxy S3 is a great addition to and S3 unit! Never a problem with his card and I can expect a long life out of this memory card too! It was for my new Galaxy note 2, I am not sure if I ever need one 64GB, but why not, when these is a bargain for one. Got for my phone and is awesome.  The card did short out but once contacting SanDisk they had one out to me in a week.  Super awesome customer service.  Will buy more SanDisk items when needed. Used as a hard drive on my Asus T100. Really fast, faster than a regular external hard drive. I used to have an old Dell computer that had only 40 gb in it. This was a lot larger and we-orks well in the Asus I just recently received a new Nook HD+ Tablet as a gift  and wanted to increase the storage capacity as well as convert it to an android base system with the N2A software! This card was compatible and has really increased the flexibility of my new Nook without having to root the system and void my warranty. I can use my new Nook either way. Plus the card was at a reasonable price and really the latest in technology! it is extremely small. so small in fact, that it could easily get lost. so i recommend that once it\\'s in, you leave it in. but it\\'s a great idea, to allow the camera\\'s, phone\\'s or any other device to be that much smaller. i\\'ve only had it for a short while, but so far so good. No Samsung Galaxy S3 should be without one!  This should last me until 128 or 256 GB models become available. :)Does NOT fit the iPhone!  No iPhone can accept Micro SD memory upgrades.  Buy a Samsung phone instead! I can\\'t say that the applications are loading faster, but I can definitely say that videos and music load much faster in my phone now. I didn\\'t have to reformat the card or anything, just transferred all DATA from old card to this one and popped it in. Considering the small price difference, I\\'d recommend getting a faster card for sure. Works great in the car as my music drive.  Holds the entire collection too.  The speed was key for me. My original two cards were manufactured in 2012 and over time started affecting the functionality of our phones.  Some internet research resulted in reading another review on Amazon with similar problems and discussed to contact SanDisk support for replacements due to a known silicon bug.  The new cards arrived in about a week and we returned the old cards with the defects.  Only hassle was was trying to read the serial and date codes off of the car, but a phone with 4X zoom made it possible.  SanDisk customer support was easy to work with and the products (new and old) are fast and worked great. Formatted in computer, popped in phone and bingo bango Bob\\'s your uncle. Phone recognized right away and I had music transferred in minutes. I purchased this to use in my Samsung camera and it works great. I take picture and videos with the camera with no issues. I use this for my R4 SDHC Dual Core for my 3DS XL. It holds about 30 movies currently, and it also holds a number of different emulators plus games, plus It holds about 150 NDS games on it as well, and I STILL HAVE 5gb of storage left for extra stuff. Simply incredible how they are able to offer that much storage in such a little package. Thank you sandisk for being the foremost leader in Memory technology. My hat goes off to you. And they do it all at an affordable price. Got extremely solid speeds with it, no slack on my Android.  Solid Micro SD card with gigantic space.It works.  Awesomely. I\\'m not a heavy user of data but enough that my pictures and music videos wouldn\\'t fit on the factory 4 gig card. You can never have enough memory as it gets used up quick. It has the advertised memory capacity rating and has improved speed on my smartphone and tablet when moving pictures and videos to different folders. No lag compared to the cheap factory memory card. Buy the better card the first time, you won\\'t be regretting it later. Would recommend and buy again I have used this to store recorded video information from a dash camera.  I have had no problems so far. I really want to like these and I do trust SanDisk more than other manufacturers of memory cards. That said, I\\'m moving on to my 3rd card. Thank you Amazon for having exceptional customer service, or else I\\'d be very upset.Basically this card will suddenly not allow writing to it anymore. You can\\'t save files to it, you can\\'t delete files from it and you can\\'t event format it. I\\'ve tried doing all three in different OS\\'es and devices with no luck. Doing some reading on the SanDisk forums this seems to be happening a lot with these cards.I\\'m returning this to Amazon and trying my luck with a different brand to see what happens. I use this to store all my music pictures and HD video on the limited storage of the surface pro and it simply works! at the price point of below 60$ I think its a steal! Perfect card, all you need to keep all the action in this 64gb. I acquired this card for a GoPro camera and fits perfectly, its all you need to capture all the action when you need it. Bought this few days after I got my phone and it has great read and write speeds and it seems like taking care of some processing and handling of things within the phone. I changed the settings that every time I take a picture or record a video, it will go automatically to the microsd card. Added most of my movies in this tiny card and it works smoothly. Fast shipping & delivered as described.Phone did not recognize the card right away. I had to format it as FAT32 on the computer but it showed capacity of 32GB. To get the full capacity I had to format it again on the phone (exFAT format) now shows 64GB.Excellent capacity for lots of media files & documents. Purchased this as a memory addition for the Surface. Great way to add all files for a meeting, so the laptop can stay behind. This card is fast enough so you can access files quick. Great Product. Nice memory card.  I think 16 gb is the sweetspot for price and size, can\\'t imagine filling it.  I only buy class-10 cards just in case a little speed boost is important.  I have this in an Android 4.2 player, works great. This works very well.  It is a class 10 memory card which ALL video cameras like.  Memory that is less than a class 6 plays back on some camcorders with a jerky playback.  Not with this memory chip.  Worth the money and at 64GB of storage lots of video time, photos and music storage.  The added value of the adapter is a plus.  This is a FIVE STAR product.  Art D  Long Island  N.Y. randomly erases all my data and asks me to format card on my unmodified unrooted sprint Galaxy SIII ,i dont know how scandisk is selling these,i trusted the brand and it didnt work As new products evolve they only accept SD and microSD cards. I\\'ve had good luck with SanDisk and this is no exception. Got this to use with my GoPro, give 2 hours of recording time, once II figured out how to use the camera. Works in all my sd devices. I bought this one for my smart phone. plug and play! works great. Would definitely recommend this card and the seller to my friends. I purchased this to add storage to my Samsung Galaxy Note 3... and it works GREAT!Fast speed, easy snap-in install.  Not a moment\\'s problem.Highly recommend this SanDisk Ultra 32 GB Micro SD to anyone planning to use with Smartphone or Tablet. I haven\\'t used it extensively at this point, but it holds my data well...as it should. SanDisk continues to be a solid brand. I have owned and used this in my Galaxy SIII for a few months now.  I have never had any problems with it.  It is fast.  I never even think about running out of space on my phone now.  It shows up as 29.71 GB total capacity and I still have 22.86 GB left. Slipped perfectly into the microSD card slot of my Galaxy Note 2 and was immediately available. No formatting required, and writes to this card are fast enough to use it for video captures. Sweet! I used this SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s to expand my Surface RT and it is really excellent. Phone missing extra storage space? This was a great purchase and at a great price with Amazon. Would recommend for the movie watcher or photo/music enthusiast. The card was fast enough for HD video recording with my Sony ActionCam as-15 and it is very durable. Great stuff Well not much to say...its a good mmc and its fast enough and that\\'s about all you can ask for, using for more storage on my tablet.Update: stopped working after a while, computer said the mmc had an error and after an hour I could not fix, it became locked and would not unlock with any sd adapters I used and because its locked it would not format or erase and wouldn\\'t even read because of the error. It stopped working after amazons very short return policy so I was out of luck with them, luckily SanDisk has a very long (10-lifetime) for its ultra brands, even though it was a hassle and all through email only I got a replacement and that\\'s why I only took one star off Reliable and inexpensive. However, it\\'s quite slow, far, far slower than the 64GB samsung pro microsdxc. The Samsung works well for interactive use while I would only use this Sandisk card for applications where speed isn\\'t important. this sd card is very compatible with samsung galaxy s4I recomended it to all galaxy s4 owners &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;regards Good quality. I\\'ve been using it several devices (phone, tablet, and computer) with no troubles at all. Glad I chose this one. -Great storage-Low price-Good transfer rate-Respond and read time is good-almost 14.8 will be available for user usage Not much more to say, really. Work, is faster than my Class 4 16GB card and provides the space to copy DSLR photos (when I hook the phone to my Nikon 5100 with the USB host cable) It\\'s a memory card, stores memory well, no problems after 2 months of use in my Note 2. Great price online. I had this for my smart phone and it kept dismounting itself.  I did some research and found out that there are others experiencing the same problem.  So, I returned this and got Transcend instead.  Transcend works fine with no problem. Great product! came with an adapter to plug into a camera or a regular sized card reader. The ultra allows for faster uploads and downloads onto the card!  Great for pictures and apps! I bought this primarily to use in my Surface Pro. It would randomly dismount itself. I do not know if it was the Surface\\'s fault or the card\\'s fault. Upon doing a little internet searching, I found this to be a common problem with Sandisk cards and the Surface Pro. I used another brand microSDXC and it has worked fine. This card was used in a phone without a large amount of write stress (which does shorten the life of the card - it was not written to over and over in the phone).The card is now totally unwriteable - on a Mac, a Linux machine, or the phone - writes all \"seem\" to succeed but even low-level reformats don\\'t actually *do* anything - the exact same files are there after every change, untouchable and frozen forever.10 months of use out of a memory card and then a really weird failure like this (neither the Mac, Linux machine, or phone reports any error) is not acceptable quality from SanDisk. ...and they\\'re right!This microSDHC card is fast. I started formatting it a little behind another class 10 card (not a UHS-1) card and it formatted all 32GB ahead of the Transcend 16GB card - which is no slouch either! It\\'s the fastest flash card I\\'ve sent yet. I doubt you will be disappointed unless you\\'re an alien with more advanced technology. I cannot gauge if its better or faster than a class 4 or 6. I use it in my mobile and it saves pictures just as quickly. Dont see a difference. But it has advertised capacity and works ok. Just great, I hadn\\'t been problems with my memory and I use it with my S3 all the time, so its great. There\\'s not much to be said for this except that it works as advertised.  I\\'m happy with the purchase and would buy again. As an photographer I rely on high quality cards for my images...this one does the job and then some.  Two thumbs up !! Been using it for a month and everything works fine.I have my SD card encrypted and it does take a little bit longer to transfer.It does get warm when I transfer files for more than 2 minutes but I have not had any performance issues with it.Overall 5/5 This is my 4th unit that I had purchased from SanDisk. Used it in a Sony Z Tablet, Note 2, S4, Q10 and most recently the Sony Z1 smartphone. Data transfer speeds are quick and you get consistent transfers without any errors.A worth buy! Sandisk is a popular brand name product, which I have used for years. I bought this for my new camera, for recording video, and it has worked well so far.. have not tried it with my gopro camera yet.  It may be a little slow for fast action videos. Very good product. I got tired of taking pictures and the memory is not over. So good that I bought another I wanted a memory card for my phone so I started looking around online, this is by far one of the best you can get and the price is un-beatable 64GB for this price is a nice deal, especially when you are trying to add storage capability for a tablet or phone.  Keep in mind that not all phones/tablets/devices support 64GB, so you may have to get the 32 GB instead.  Performance is very good, especially when weighing with price and capacity. I own several video recording devices (Surveillance, car-based DVR systems, etc.), and the SanDisk Class 10 cards (always use class 10 cards when dealing with HD video) are the only ones which survive these extreme environments.I have been using SanDisk for years, and while I do admit to trying other great brands once in a while, I always come back to SanDisk, and will stick with it.Many non SanDisk brand cards might advertise Class 10 as well, but don\\'t achieve the same writing speeds.  In fact, cheaping out on these cards may result in your video recording devices to become unstable, or worse, corrupt data.Highly recommended! I have had this for 8 months, and the SD Card already stopped deleting files and keeping pictures.  I have tried reformatting, and nothing helps.  Not cool.Update - April 2, 2014 - I contacted Sandisk and I am sending the problematic card back for warranty replacement.  I hope this will resolve the issue with the card.  I will keep you updated once the process is complete. I bought it to expand my Surface RT tablet, reliable and stable my data is intact and secure.Highly recommended Worked perfectly right out of the box, and seems to be a lot faster than the old class 10 that were manufactured by SanDisk, or others for that matter. Have not experienced any wirting speed problem with my android sticks or PC. So I suppose it lives up to the 10X claimed. Tried with both SDHC & SDXC readers on both abdroid TV\\'s and PC\\'s USB ports, and all worked as smmoth as silk. It works fine in my Verizon Galaxy S3 but has to be formated to FAT32.  Also works in my Canon IXUS 80. Still wondering how they fit 64,000,000,000 bites on a card like this. But this car is plenty fast and compatible with my devices. It has worked fine, so I have no complaints.  I\\'ve purchased SanDisk products several times and have been happy with this brand. I\\'ve been used this prdoduct on the Past and it has great whit my Past Galaxy Note 2 for Store almost anything on my Device This card failed after 2 weeks of use.  I have the same problem with their SSD failed on me after 6 months. Fast , no problems , i loved the price and it worked immediately , never caused me any problems.... Oh just remembered when i place it into the sd card to make it fit into the pc ,,, usually the micro sd get stuck in the holder , that i did not like It worked in my android phone and will hold all my music, so i like it so far and would recommend I got this to go in my smart phone and it does the job great!  Inexpensive and it includes an adaptor card so I can use it in applications without a micro-SD slot.  This expands its versatility. I bought this to upgrade the 32GB MicroSD that was in my Samsung Galaxy S5. This works great!I recommend this for everyone. Whether I\\'m on vacation or just taking photos and videos around the house I don\\'t trust any other memory cards to keep all my memories.  I bought this card mainly for my Contour ROAM 2 Helmet Cam, but I\\'ve been using SanDisk Compact Flash Cards in my Canon DSLR and SanDisk SD Cards in my Panasonic HMC40 video camera and I\\'ve never had a single problem.  They don\\'t fail, I\\'ve never had a file corrupted, they\\'ve survived x rays at the airport and extreme weather conditions.  Sometimes I\\'m tempted with the prices of other memory cards but in the end I go with the SanDisk for that warm and fuzzy feeling of knowing all my photos and videos will be perfectly safe. Used in my gopro. it holds a massive amount of video. No problems with it. It does what it is supposed to. Works great in GoPro Hero 3+. Super fast and gives plenty of storage capacity to video every outdoor activity I need. Works great! Perfect price,I\\'m using mine for my digital camera, and my DJI Phantom FC40.The chip holds tons of data and is exactly what I needed!Highly recommend for anyone needing both micro and standard SD. It\\'s great to have the ability to plug and play to get the data!Buy it, Buy it! BUY IT!For the money I should have got the 64GB card.I will be buying more. My Android tablet is a toy; there is nothing crucial on it. I plan on downloading maps for travel, and need more storage.I rooted my tablet, changed two lines in a control file, and now it sees the external card as the internal card (and vice versa). When I save apps and/or data to the SD card, everything goes to the 32GB SanDisk Ultra MicroSDHC card instead of the puny internal store! Woo-hoo!DISCLAIMER: Rooting a device usually voids its warranty. I am not condoning such action, nor am I responsible for the results of such action. The responsibility is yours.The tiny card fit into the tiny slot on my 9&#34;-screened tablet, and is invisible once installed. But we both know it\\'s there! I couldn\\'t be happier, and until that changes, this is my endorsement of the SDHC card. great deal fast data good price . you can use it for any thing . you dont need card reader , it comes with one already Works just fine.  Came with an adapter for a standard size card slot.  Installed in a Samsung Mini Tab 2. I got a few of these for tablets and phones and they have been fine. I loaded them with movies for a trip and they playback was perfect. I used one in a camera for video and it was plenty fast enough for the clips I was taking. buy this one. it was inserted in my galaxy note 2, and also my asus transformer infinity. i bought 2 of these cards. i will buy it again if i need to. its easy to install, just pop it in and your device reads it. it\\'s that simple! stored over 2000 pics in good quality and were transferred to laptop from tablet, very happy with San Disk Ultra Just the right size for my knitting and crafting patterns, lets me take them anywhere I go and helps when buying yarn and fabric because all the info I need is on my Nook. It works like sed it dose it\\'s fast and works in my Xoom and have used it in my hd1010 xacti camera with an adapter. I bought this micro SD card for my Samsung pocket camera.I was amazed at how much storage I could shoot video in HD 1080 on such a tiny card.So far it is performing  nicely. Installed in my Samsung Galaxy S4 (AT&T) for music, photos and video storage.  Works perfectly, never had a glitch in 6 months. (Formated as exFAT) Upgraded from the 32GB and very satisfied. Works great with my phone and large library of music. Def would reccomend. Although it may be overkill for the application, considering its capacity, this appears to work very well for firmware memory for the Raspberry Pi, and at the price I bought it for on last year\\'s Cyber-Monday, I wish I could buy a few more of them for the same price.  I haven\\'t tried it with the RPi overclocked, but it\\'s worked without a glitch at the normal RPi clock rate.  I\\'ve also used the 32GB version of this in my music player, and it has worked well also. Recently upgraded to Samsung Note II. I\\'ve been wanting to carry more of my music. Turns out I only had a total of 12GB of music. But with the new 64GB card, that still gives me another 52GB for my photos, spreadsheets, word docs and PDF docs. I\\'ve been listening to my music stored on this card--No delays. I bought this for my son\\'s Samsung Galaxy S4.  He had an 8gb card but it was filled.  This has more than enough space and the speed is excellent. He told me it is very fast compared to his last card. I would recommend this for sure. Hard to review this as the card arrived DOA. Couldn\\'t write to it at all, and it wouldn\\'t format. I returned it and Amazon was great about the credit. I\\'ve owned several SanDisk memory cards and they have all performed well and I was a little surprised that this one failed out of the box. I\\'d read a good review of the Samsung 64GB micro card and I bought that instead. Very pleased with it. I use these for every project I work on.  It\\'s a brand I trust and excited to continue with.  :) Stopped working and could not reformat.  Didn\\'t have good luck with this item or the vendor selling this item.  Hopefully just a bad one...sandisk is usually pretty good I loaded this memory card into my TF700T and could not get it to install. I found it to be a format issue and could not reformat it to get it to work. I sent it back and got the class 10 sandisc card ( non ultra ) and it loaded perfactly. This is the first class 10 memory card I have had and boy is it fast, I actually bought two, one for my digital camera and one for my Galaxy 2 7.0.  Saves images really fast in my camera and does not slow down my tablet at all, great product at a great price. Perfect card for my Galaxy S3 - lots of capacity at a decent price, and not a no-name brand either. Couldn\\'t wait to test it when I got home. Yes, the capacity is 128GB but shows less due to binary code. I managed to stuff 53 Hi-Def movies on to this. That is just insane. Speed is pretty good too. I managed 17MB/sec write and 45MB/sec read using a USB3.0 reader. This is for files 64KB or bigger. It slows down substantially with smaller files - typical for SD cards and thumb drives.Great warranty and only a small premium over 2 x 64GB cards.No regrets - highly recommended if you can get it at a decent price. Fantastic product as it is described. I purchased 2 of them. Delivery was fast. I will definitely buy it again and recommend this product to anyone. Excellent quality memory; good deal for the price! It functioned perfectly, good speed, and meets all my needs. I would definitely recommend for anyone using tablets. I am planning to buy another one shortly. wouldn\\'t trade it for anything. i need the extra space, so it is very helpful. and sandisk always makes good stuff I use this in my Canon digital SLR.  Has lots of memory and the quality of images are great.  No disappointments. I bought this about 5 months ago, give or take. I needed if for my Galaxy S3. It works perfect. We have bought two of these.  You get an open slot with your smartphone and you should use it.  Pictures, movies, and music will fill up your primary device storage in a heartbeat.  Further, it is a good practice to have your &#34;personal&#34; stuff, like the things I just mentioned, saved to an external drive so as to not be in the mix should the horrific happen and you have to get your phone wiped.Word to the wise:  ENCRYPT YOUR STORAGE, both Primary Device and External SD.  For the Samsung Galaxy S4 (at least), that, in turn, requires that you use a phone unlock code of at least SIX characters, with at least one of them being non-numeric.  I know this can appear to be a pain in the butt, but the first time your device is ganked and you aren\\'t panicking because your stuff is encrypted, you\\'ll thank me.  Nekkid pictures aren\\'t the only things of concern, mind you.  An unencrypted device, stolen by the wrong hands, isn\\'t just $25 in crack cocaine money...it is much, much more than that in terms of lucrative identity theft opportunities.  Don\\'t be &#34;that guy&#34;.  Encrypt your phone.  There are walk-throughs showing how to do that for whatever device you happen to have on YouTube, I am certain. Installed into my galaxy s3 and it reads and writes very fast. Having that much storage is awesome. It had over 59 gb after formating. This Works As Expected And is WAYYYY faster than my 8Gig Class 2 card.my old card would slow down my phone as it was close to being full and would take forever to load up everything Music Files, Pictures Etc. This Card however I\\'ve Loaded more than 8GB of stuff on there, Put everything from my old Card and more, It Reads and loads Up Fine, No need to wait. BuY THIS CARD Could not ask for anything more. It is exactly as advertised and I have no issues. I have not gotten to try it in a UHS device yet but cannot wait to do so. Bought it for my S4; it Works like a charm.  No setup needed, my S4 reads it automatically.  Great price. :) Bought this for my new Samsung digital camera. No complaints. It does what it\\'s supposed to do, and I haven\\'t noticed any problems with quality. I run this in my Samsung Galaxy II. Works like a champ and it\\'s really fast. Unless your phone supports exFAT this is as big as you can go. It might find it, but you will only be able to use 32GB...that\\'s why the file system is called FAT32. The internal memory on my ASUS tablet is kinda slow.  I installed this bad boy into my tablet and install the OS onto it.  Now the tablet runs nice and fast! My old microsd causes images taken to get corrupted probably because of the write speed it can\\'t handle. This one works great! It has been a a few months and it still working good. I haven\\'t seen any problem at. It seems pretty fast compare to my old  transcend. I would recommend it as Sandisk is already proven. It might cost a little more but it seems more reliable. Figured there was not going to be any issues with SanDisk; produce arrived in well packaged - removed it, formatted it on computer, and installed. Working fine! Worked good in my talbet and gave it more space too do more games and pictures and download too save all your pictures What can I say about a memory card?  I purchased it to increase the memory in my phone, it fits as it should, and works as it should. What can I say SanDisk has the micro SD figured out.  Works with Asus Memo pad hd 7, movies for long trips. What can i say my old 8GB died and this is working like a champ trust the brand for a long time and expect nothing but the best My S3 did not recognize card when it was formatted exFAT.  S3 seems to have problem supporting exFAT format in higher capacity like 32gb or 64gb.When I inserted the SD card, it just kept saying that SD card was \"damaged\" and I just got stuck on \"Unmounting SD card\" screen when I tried to format it on my phone.I just manually formatted the SD card to FAT32 in Windows 8 and inserted it into my phone.It runs smooth now.  Seems like a lot of people are having trouble to get the SanDisk 64gb to work in S3.  Hope this helps. Look no further. Perfect for my galaxy devices. I purchased a few of these and switch them between devices for quick data transfer. Highly recommended. This is a very good item, fits perfectly in my tablet, its confortable, and protect it. Works very nice, great item... I got this to put in the i9 by cect that I got through amazon and it works great. bye I almost got myself a 16GB but decided on the 32GB last minute.  I\\'m so glad I did - I filled up my Hero3 White edition with over 20k time-lapse images and a few hours of HD footage.  These things are solid and reliable.  I filled it up over a 6 day period doing some work in Haiti. Can be used with my phone as well as with my computers, thanks to the included adapter. I use these to back up/store pictures and documents instead of a separate external hard drive... I just put a number on the disk, as well as a numbered label on the plastic storage case it comes with, so I can remember what is on which disk. Easy to use and store! Really fast processing speeds and saves crystal clear footage. Haven\\'t had any problems with it and don\\'t expect to have any. I\\'ve had other Sandisk memory cards, and they\\'ve always proven reliable. As always with memory, get the biggest you can afford, because you\\'ll always need more than you think, and volume gets more economical with greater capacity. Ive had the card for over a month, using it in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.I filled the card with a few TV shows and movies to watch on the go, as well as many PDFs and MS Word Docs.The MS Word and PDF files often get corrupted after use. THe larger files seem to stay intact. I moved the smaller files into the internal storage and havent had problem since.Im hoping Sandisk has a decent return policy. Using this for expanded storage on my Nexus 7 (via Mini SD USB Reader for Android) and it\\'s working great. Instantly adds more storage for music, movies, tv, etc... I bought this to use with my GoPro Hero3 Black, and it works great! No problems at all. For the price, it\\'s hard to beat. I get about 3mb/s, and the formatted capacity is closer to 27 gb. However the extra storage is very useful, it has some quirks. You can\\'t move anything to the recycle bin. It doesn\\'t work. You have to permanently delete it. I didn\\'t see this brand listed on the GoPro website as one of the recommended cards but I\\'ve never had an issue with SanDisk before so I gave it a try. It is a UHS1 card so it doesn\\'t ever stop recording due to write errors. For the price, you can\\'t beat the quality that comes with it. It also included a microSD to Standard SD card adapter so that you don\\'t need a different card reader if you have one for your old SD cards. I love the additional storage for my pics/videos on my S3.  So far no problems.  Reads/writes with no problems or delays.  I got a great price on this as a gold box deal.  Too bad I could only purchase 1.  I can also use in most of my other devices with an adapter. This microsd card has been working fine in my Android phone for several months.  I have had no problem with speed or data corruption thus far. Comes in an open package, no box included except for the instruction manual/warranty. Using this on my cell phone and works great. Read/Write speeds are noticeably faster than my old Sandisk 32gb MicroSD. Got this MicroSDXC for my GoPro. I\\'ve got more than enough space not to worry about changing my simcard, but more about changing my battery. See above.  Nice to have the extra room in my Blackberry Z30.  LOTS of content goes with me.  Packaging was adequate but not over-the-top. Fast and reliable. So far no problems in my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. Plus I got it on sale and well worth price. I upgraded from my 8 GB SD to this one and it was great to have the extra space.No problems with it.I removed the SD card from my phone and copied the files up to my computer using the adapter that came with the new card.  I copied the files to my new 32 GB MicroSDHC and installed it in my Galaxy S4 and it worked great.I liked the color. Makes it easier to see on my black desk. I bought this for my new samsung galaxy s 4, and the first one I ordered produced formatting issues on my phone every time I rebooted. I looked online and found a number of these got recalled (or something) at one point, and some didn\\'t but just don\\'t work.I returned it for a replacement and the replacement has worked fine in my phone with constant use. I\\'m on month 4 with no issues. fast and giv, works great No way to format it. I even downloaded 2 programs that claimed were able to format it, After wasting about 6 hours, I decided to give up and send it back, The seller should format them before sending them, even if they would charge $5. extra, it would be well worth it instead of the hassle of downloading programs and wasting time trying and sending it back after hours of frustration. Needed to update the card in my Galaxy S4. Bought this one on sale. Installed it and it works fine. Loaded it up with music and have also used it for storing photos and videos from the phone. Big fan of SanDisk products. I bought 2 of this, one for a Hero3 camera and one for a Galaxy S3 mini, They both work excelent, recommended for video shooting. Very good price!With the adapter you can use it on a SD card reader (SDHC compatible) I needed some new micro SD cards for my Flash Boot Project and required stable speeds. Sandisk provided the product I required with optimal speeds and stability along with quality and warranty. Bought to increase memory in my Samsung Galaxy III.  Use my phone for business and pleasure and needed the memory upgrade. Works great. I purchased this to use in a Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It worked fine for about a month, then the phone stopped recognizing it. I was able to copy my photos before the computer stopped recognizing it as well. SanDisk replaced it under warranty and so far the new one has been fine. I prefer the San Disk brand over other types.  This is a great size for phones & camera\\'s.  I would buy again. I bought this for my husband and then the 32 GB one went on sale so I bought that one for him. I use this one in my Tablet and I love it! No issues!! I\\'ve used a number of these.  Just bought some more.  They\\'re well rated.  they\\'ve always worked well for me.  Good price. Worked well after reformatting. Good thing I was able to download the free app on line after reformatting. Memory to spare. I like being able to download and snap photos without thinking how much space left in the phone. I was better off with my 32gig card.  This thing was nothing but problems.  The phone does not see it half the time and it is SLOW.  The phone keeps asking to Re- format it.  I got it to see the card after a reboot.  It is still SLOW.I will be buying the Samsung 64gig card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 1.  I have seen good things from Samsung. I bought this for my GoPro and it does great. The only problem I experience with it is, if you download your pictures and videos from the day, you should re-format the card before trying to use it again. It seems to get confused where you left off when you re-install it. I lost out on getting some pictures and video because of not doing this on the second day of my SCUBA vacation. When I would start the GoPro in video mode, it would record about 6-15 seconds then stop automatically. Haven\\'t have anymore problems since re-formatting after each night\\'s downloading. The videos, set on 1080 looks great. Worked for awhile and then android would blow chunks (unexpectedly removed).  Windows sometimes could not read them and just blew up explorer.  Formated FAT32 .... ect ect ect over and over.  I\\'m done with SanDisk.  I think the problem is the CLASS 10 part of these cards.  All other cards I have work fine and they are less than class 10.  Maybe this was a bad batch because my replacement card a few days later (from Amazon) did the same thing again.EDIT: Decided to pick up the card that was laying on my counter for the last 3 months and give things another try.  Still does not work in HTC Evo LTE or EVO 3D.  Finally got it working in Galaxy S3.  Still very frustrating. Super fast reading and writing. This thing performs under extreme condition; writing multiple large files, videos and photos, all at the same time. Have owned it for about 2 weeks now, and extremely happy with it.Formatting is super easy and fast Insert it and use it, it is exactly that easy to use. And did I mention it is also very fast? I purchased this for my new Nook HD+ tablet and it gives me a lot of storage space for anything I wish to keep on the tablet, pictures, music, documents, eBooks, anything else I wish to create or copy to the tablet. I am very pleased with the performance and price of this purchase. Very fast! Decent price.I use this for my phone, and it does the job. Never had any problems, it\\'s a class 10 card so it has plenty of speed for reading and writing. Will buy again =) Bought for my wifes Samsung Galaxy 3 Tab. Lots of storage for pictures and music. Good product at reasonable price. seems to be working just fine...bought as a gift for a family member and they\\'re using it for video recording. What can I say? It works and was formatted for an android already. Tho\\' I\\'m sure it will work w/ anything! I have owned many an SD card in the past, and this is probably the best bang for the buck I\\'ve ever received in a card.  I\\'m not super nitpicky about data read/write speeds necessarily, but this card is plenty fast for me in my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  Pick one up while they are on sale! does very good..... holds a lot of songs...... Plugged in and worked out of the box in my Samsung Note 2 (Verizon).  Using an app to test the speed while it\\'s in my Note, was hitting 8 - 15 mb/s for writing (avg high 8s), consistently in the 10mb/s for reading, so this seems like a legit class 10, and I don\\'t think the write test really worked the greatest for whatever reason.  I\\'m with WinXP still, but to anyone else wondering, the exfat format the card comes in is what you want, don\\'t format to fat32 if you computer can\\'t read it, your phone/tablet/etc. most likely will read it fine. able to capture 1080p full Hd on my blackberry z10 now.  with my other card i was only able to do 720 A micro card that has 64G still just blows my mind. I put this card in my Galaxy Tab and I love it. It gives me plenty of storage for my music, videos, movies, photos, etc. The speed is awesome too. That makes uploading to it that much more enjoyable. I recommend it. I use mine inside a dash camera which records continuously while the car is being driven. No problems so far. Having the SD adapter included is nice. Its in my GoPro and the memory card easily captures 2 hrs of video.It can get more the battery only lasts 2 hrs. Got it for my cell phone, Samsung Galaxy S4.  Works just like one would expect and appears to be quite fast. I like to keep track of the &#34;Daily Deals&#34; and check them almost daily (resulting in me spending more than I should), but this was too good of a deal to pass up.  I will be upgrading my cell phone soon, so I knew I would be needing it soon.  So, at $30 (with an adaptor and in retail packaging) I jumped at it and am glad I did! Fast and reliable.  Well worth the price.  Works in my android tablet 7.0 with no problems.  Setup was no problem. Slides right into devices with ZERO instructions needed, comes with \"Reader.\" Adds lots of Storage space to your Reader or other device. Firmly snaps into place. Easy to read on screen instructions for what to store on device and what to store on SD Card. Probably enough storage space to handle most people\\'s personnel information needs.  Just don\\'t forget where you hide it. Shop around, and you will be surprised how good of a deal this is.Combine it with something else to get free shipping, and it\\'s a low cost winner.Technically speaking it works great, especially for a Go Pro Camera which will benefit greatly from the enhanced storagecapacity.Put it in a digital camera, and you won\\'t need to worry about running out of space.Just bought my second one, that\\'s how much I like/recommend it Bought 2 of these for the wife\\'s & my Android phone. When her\\'s failed after 2 months, we figured it was just luck of the draw. Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won\\'t be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate.EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this.Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn\\'t buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell). Up until now I had an overall neutral to favorable opinion of them, not anymore.If you think I am overreacting, please just skim through a few pages submitted in springtime of 2013. There is at least one or more \"6 months and it failed\" reviews per page. What is this thing? Oh, yeah. A memory card!It does what it says and nothing else.Keep remembering things even when you forget. Like my last girlfriend! I\\'m using this in a NOOK HD+ (Customized Android OS). I use it mostly for music, a few docs. It works as expected with no problems. I have several SanDisk MicroSD cards, but this is the only XC card. They have all performed as expected. I have been pleased with both his memory card, as well as the other SanDisk cards. All I can say is, these are probably the best I could find, fast and furious!If you dont get class 10, you are taking the risk of dropped frames on your HD videos.besides they are pretty too! To begin, I am not that knowledgeable in tech matters so when I received a new Galaxy Note 2 as a gift and decided to add storage I read some reviews on the SD cards and was reading about the compatibility of the 64 GB cards (exFAT or Fat? I guess the exFAT was a successful diet), I was concerned somewhat but I ordered this one anyway and this is what my experience was. I added some music and videos onto the card using my Apple Macbook Air with no problems and then inserted it into the Note 2 with no problems and it immediately loaded everything with no problems. I have since taken it out and added some more music to it and it is working perfectly. I did not reformat or anything like that which was a great relief. Although I have only used this item for a week now with issue which means something could go wrong in the future, I would give it more than 5 stars if possible because it was easy for someone like me. I know I used the phrase no problems multiple times but when you are my age and things go smoothly with no problems it is very good. I bought this for my Lenovo A2109 tablet which alot of sites say wont work.  Once I formatted it to FAT32 it worked flawlessly.  Its fast and provides tons of storage to my 16gb tablet. works as expected and was nice that it came with a holder. Not sure what else you can say about a chip, either it works or it don\\'t? One never knows until they use it for a while how it is working... It\\'s a micro sd hc, stores files, and is great at it.I don\\'t really know enough about these kinda things to go into details of how fast it is at transfering files.But it worked great for copying video files from my computer, placing the same thing into my LED tv (has a USB port) and watching the files from there. 8gb video files would play perfectly fine. Perhaps that\\'s saying enough about it? Worth the money! The product is OK, but my card does not acheive the rated write speed of 10 MB/sec.  Most applications probably don\\'t need to hit 10 MB/sec, but my GoPro Hero 3 does need the full bandwidth and thus would bomb on me sometimes.  As tested, my card got between 8-10 MB/sec using the larger block sizes.  I complained to Sandisk about it and they allowed me to send it in for a replacement which I did (and took almost 2 weeks), but the replacement behaved the same way.  I would say this card is OK for most applications, but if you need top end speed, I would go with another card.  I bought my card in May 2013 and had it replaced in August 2013 so hopefully they have fixed this problem by now. Pay attention to your application and what class your card is!  Class 4 or unclassed may be cheaper but it may not give you the performance you want. Don\\'t be pennywise and poundfoolish... this was purchased to go into one of the newer MK808 version tv streamer dongles and those take class 10. For the price this was a good value.I have been using SanDisk xD and sD regular and micro for 8 years now and always found them to be a consistent and high grade storage card. I can recommend this brand. I bought a couple of these to use with a GoPro HERO camera. Since I\\'ve never had bad luck with a SanDisk product, I chose this to store my precious photos and videos on. A class 10 device, it can not only store average video, photos and sound, but is fast enough the handle the 3 shot per half second rate the cameras multi-shot mode demands. Losing pictures, video, and tunes after 9 months on a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (stock android).  Looks like this is a common problem.  I will try my luck with Sandisk on Monday.  If I don\\'t get a replacement, I will never buy a Sandisk product again.  I paid the premium for \"Sandisk Quality.\"  I am very disappointed.UPDATE:Sandisk will be providing a replacement SD CARD.  However, my data loss and downtime cannot be replaced.  SanDisk lost their \"premium rating\" in my eyes. It\\'s going to take a while for them to get it back. I bought this card as high speed external memory for my Asus ME302C tablet to play movies, music, etc. The card meets all of my expectations, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it had absolutely no crapware preloaded. No compatibility issues whatsoever. I did not do any bench tests to see to verify the read and white but been very happy with it. These things hardly go wrong, last forever, the bigger the better!With  SanDisk\\'s  long-standing reputation,  at the right price point ( preferably at least $0.75  per GB or lower),  prIices can only continue to drop as technology improves.Not much to think about really. if you need the space, at this price,  you\\'ve hit a sweet spot for the moment.Great thing about micro SD cards  is their versatility.  You can stick it in your camera,  then stick it in your phone to review &  share. Tge speed  of these cards &  price/capacity  used  to be a problem. No longer. Now just watch the price of 64 GB cards  as the next level of resistance.Order was delivered on time,  price was right,  it\\'s humming away reliably in my phone at the moment. What not to like? Purchased it for DATA2SD on my Asus Transformer Prime. It did a great job but eventually the tablet started slowing down anyway so I have replaced it with a Samsung Tablet, which I will use the SD card in it but as a regular form of storage. Works great with the GoPro camera!I can get about 3 days of kayaking video and photos on it.Price was fair. This is great. I use this with my Contour Roam camera. Works great. lots of room for video. Transfer speeds are as expected. Card works fine at 1080p on my Gopro Hero 3 plus.  Works great in my Transend USB 3.0 reader as well. Came with adapter as described and works perfectly. I use this SDHC card with my GoPro Hero 3+ black and haven\\'t been able to fill it up yet. Great capacity. I purchased this when I first purchased my phone (Samsung Galaxy S3) and have had no issues with it. Great write speed. Excellent way to store all your music, videos and photos. Great to take videos with as well. More than enough capacity for anything I\\'d need it for on my phone. Can\\'t go wrong with the SanDisk name either. An industry leader and well known for quality. Of course you always want to backup any and all of your data for continuity purposes, but I\\'ve never had any issues with this card. I bought this for my Canon DSLR. It works great, no delay in photograph shots. Also, no visible lag effects with video. Will re-purchase. My gps has plenty more space now to update it\\'s maps. It works so that is all there is to know. I haven\\'t done any formal benchmarks, but the device seems pretty slow. I haven\\'t seen any real performance boost vs. my old card even on bulk file copies. I have another 8GB samsung card that may be a knockoff that performs noticeably better than this card.I\\'m using it anyway. I don\\'t really have the time to return it or anything. This is a nice card. Holds about 29 GB. You can store data on it. It is a microSDHC card. My Samsung Galaxy S4 seemed to take to it right away.  It snapped into place without issue and began working without formatting question. Works great, good transfer speed, capacity is as claimed.Only con I can think of is that it\\'s too small and this is the second one I\\'m buying because I lost my first one while playing with my phone in bed and could not find it ever again. It\\'s probably stuck in some sheets or the bed frame, I tried but can\\'t seem to locate it anymore. I had just discovered and saved the cure to cancer on that card and I cannot remember what it was now. Sorry. boost the mp3 player size thanks, more more if you have the music or video\\'s can not go wrong with more memory Lot\\'s of space now! My Galaxy was getting full, so I got this. Tons of space for movies and music and pictures and videos and kindle. Get the point? Lots of space. I was impress with the value and quality. I used SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 with my ASUS 300TF it works great! Class 10 speed works great in my camera takes videos. Finally the price of these decent sized cards are coming down. Well pleased. I got this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 when it was on sale. My fairly new internal card reader wasn\\'t able to write to it so I tried 2 different USB adapters and they didn\\'t work either. I installed it in my phone and was able to copy files via USB. It was slow but it worked and is great in the phone. works as advertised.  Wish more companies made good products.  I still have plenty of storage available and it runs quick and safely. I purchased 2 128GB SD cards, one for my Nokia Lumia 1520, and another for my Surface Pro 2, both devices took the card without any issues.As for read/Write speeds, I am sure there are better options, but this is the only 128GB Micro SD card available right now, and Sandisk did an amazing job with the product.And currently at $119.99(For how long, I am not sure), it\\'s a great deal, considering a lot of the good SD cards are in the $140 range still.No issues with either card unmounting itself, put them in, transfer files, and you\\'re good. This card is doing its job in my S4. Lots of room for storing photos, music and videos. Good item. Realistically I probably could have gotten away with a 16GB card, but like anything, it\\'s better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. Popped it into my moblie phone an put all my music on it, plus enough room for photos or videos, etc.No hiccups or errors yet and holds a ton of stuff. I have nothing to use this device with. I ordered by mistake. I\\'m sure it\\'s a great product but not for me. Bought this for the GoPro Hero3 and it works as advertised with no issues. Since I bought this, I have learned to watch for sales because they tend to get deeply discounted at local retailers every once in a while. I could not get this brand of memory card to work in my Roku.  It would not format correctly.  I had to return this for another brand which worked ok. I shopped several other places for a good deal on a quality memory card and found it at amazon once again I use SDHC in my many cameras. They work well. So far, so good - seems very stable - used in Logitech Alert cameras to replace the 2GB supplied with camera - extends recordings to a much longer history (months vs days!) Great price and it works perfectly in the Hero 3. No need to pay the store\\'s high prices for these type of items. Amazon is the way to go. I bought this for my grandson to use in his GoPro camera; he says it works great, and if he is happy, all is good. He is quite knowledgeable and critical of all things technical, so if he says it is good, it is good. And the price on Amazon was good too with free Prime shipping So far so good. No problems using this with a Nook HD even though it\\'s Class 10. This includes playing downloaded videos. I put this baby in my Galaxy Note II, formatted it, and ran an SD card app to test it.  All seems to work well, maxs out my memory. Great microSD card for your phone to upgrade you with additional 32 gigs of space.  The beauty of having a huge microSD in your phone is that you can store all of your music and pictures and stuff on there and then swap it into a new phone or replacement when that happens and not have to transfer anything over manually. It was what i expected.Didn\\'t test his real speed but as price and size and with adaptor from microsd to SD card for me was ok. I have a Samsung Note2, I love being able to record video and taking pictures without worrying about not having enough room, now I do! I purchased this Micro SD card to add storage to my Acer tablet. Unfortunately the tablet did not recognize the device. After uninstalling the card several times I decided to use it in my Samsung phone and it works fine there.If you are going to buy this product for a tablet, I recommend you do you research and make sure it\\'s compatible. Excellent SD card and very good value. Have had no issues with mine or my wife\\'s. Definitely recommend this SD card I got to of these cards:-  One in a Samsung Galaxy S3 => No problem so far.- One in my Asus tablet => No problem so far.Plenty of space, fast, format without a glitch. I will keep buying this product as needed until better comes on the market. Using the SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter... with my samsung tab 2 7.0 and it performs well. Used for two months in Samsung Galaxy.  Fizzled then failed.  I have never experienced a memory card or or flash drive failure until this SanDisk Ultra 32 GB.  Will purchase a different brand next time.  Return for refund or replacement is not allowed. I\\'m a music lover and like to carry my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. That being said it takes up A LOT of space, enough to fill a 64gb memory card on its own (a lot of the files are FLAC format.) I was a little hesitant to buy the 128gb card when it came out recently because with the 64gb cards the first batch were pretty much defective with resulted in a recall. Me, learning of the recall after looking up the issues I was having had to return the card I bought. SanDisk took the 64gb card back without hesitation and was actually prepared to do it without the serial number (since I couldn\\'t open my phone at the time because the case is screwed on.)Note to everyone:Quite a few applications don\\'t fully support NTFS or newer file system formats such as exFAT. To use your SD card without issues you have to format it to FAT32 which IS possible even though its over 32GB. Use the &#34;Fat32Format&#34; tool made by Ridgecrop Consultants, there\\'s a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version available for those unfamiliar with using the command line.------After receiving my new card I formatted it to fat32 since I use a lot of applications that aren\\'t the norm and it\\'s easier to use an older file system that is compatible with everything made after 1996. The transfer of files and swapping of cards was seamless, my computer\\'s micro-sd card reader recognized it without trouble as well as my phone. So far everything is good and there\\'s been no hiccups. Even Google Play has been crashing less when trying to browse my music collection. We need lots of room in the memory card.  I think there is plenty in this card and San Disk always hss a great product. I bought this for a Note 3, but I am still waiting for Verizon to ship. Meanwhile it works great with my Note 2. I keep growing with these things as they grow in capacity and speed. This device, however, stands out above all the others microSD Cards I have used. I experienced an incredible and noticeable difference in speed between this and theSanDisk 32GB microSDHC Memory Card (Bulk Package)I have used in my phone for the last two years. Besides doubling the capacity from 32GB, I am enjoying the benefit of the speed this thing brings with it and adds to my phone. The price was really right for this too. I can only imagine what theSanDisk Extreme 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQX-064G-U46A)is like. I was not yet willing to pay the price for it to find out. Works great in our smart phones.  Gives us a lot more memory.  Comes with an adapter if you require the ability to put it directly into your computer with a normal SD slot. Nice to have such a large card for very similar pricing as two smaller memory cards. Lets me have plenty of room for movies and tv shows on my tablet. Picked up this memory card at a great price on a gold box deal. Reputable name, fast card. However, after several months of trying to get my phone to work with the card, formatted it, partitioned it. &#34;mounted&#34; the card, &#34;unmounted the card,&#34; all to no avail.  I realized that this memory card is not compatible with my Samsung SGH-T769 (Galaxy S 4G). No need to get frustrated and try a Sandisk &#34;Ultra&#34; 32GB Class 10 card in the phone. I replaced this card with a &#34;plain&#34; Sandisk 32GB Class 4 card in my phone, it was immediately recognized, formatted and mounted by the Samsung phone.YMMV I use this in my GPS Unit (Older model) and it works great! No complaints. I use a 16 GB in my phone and it\\'s more than enough room! Pictures, music, etc. I have been using this in my phone for several months.  Still works great. Seems fast however i have not done any real tests. I bought this to use as expanded storage in my Asus Transformer Book T100 but it was unstable and I have had to return it. Although the tablet would see the card when it was first inserted there would be errors trying to copy files onto it and then Windows would indicate that it needed formatting. If I tried a quick format then everything seemed to be OK but the instability would return as soon as I tried to copy data to the card. If I tried a full format it always failed.I gave it two starts because it seemed to work using the supplied SD adapter in a Windows 7 laptop. I was able to do a full format on that but, when I put it back into the tablet, the problems continued. The tablet is compatible with SDXC cards and, when I tried a different micro SD card in the tablet, it worked fine so I assume it was a problem with this card. Good card at a good price but I bought it specifically for my gopro camera. Even though its a class 10, its not fast enough to record on the higher quality settings. I guess not all class 10 are the same even among the exact same cards. You will need to buy the extreme version for gopro. I purchased this to expand the internal memory of my smart phone, specifically the Galaxy S3.  It performs absolutely flawlessly.  If you have any reservations about this micrSD...don\\'t. There\\'s no need to format since it comes pre formatted. Should you desire to format,  do it from within the phones settings and again, no issues.  PLEASE, turn the phone off and remove the battery before installation...lol Fast and Reliable micro SD. Very happy with this. And a huge storage capacity for a price that makes me happy. And I hope I never do! Because of the price point and my past experience, these are usually the memory cards I go to first. I\\'ve never been let down yet. I am having some trouble with it in my cell phone (Motorola Triumph)  Music player has not been reliable since I loaded songs on it.  Not sure if it is the card or my phone and it is not a consistent problem.  I need to try it on a few other devices. I needed some extra storage for my Galaxy Note 10.1. This works perfectly in my tablet and at this time, I have yet to fill it. Copying the files I want to this have been fast and reliable. I would suggest this to anyone needing extra space. Works great with my Surface RT tablet.  Transfers to and from are very fast.  Great price for the size and speed. As soon as this card arrived I tested some clips I recorded in full HD video (1920 x 1080p x 30FPS) from my Canon T3i.  The card performed flawlessly.I purchased this to expand my Surface Pro\\'s available memory and I am very pleased. I use this in my Trailcam and it works great. I take an old camera with me in the woods to just flip through the pics and delete. this works just exactly the same as others listed for 2 times the prices. Thank you for offering it at this price. its a sandisk, cant go wrong. i use it for my gopro and it dont skip a beat. i have 2 of these and they write data fast. Love Sandisk, never had a problem with them and still have not. Popped this into my Samsung Galaxy Relay 4g running Android 4.0.4 and the phone detected it without a problem. Has the write speeds expected and gets the job done. Would recommend a different card if you plan to go to 64gb, buy the Samsung UHS-1 SDXC, writes at much higher speeds and has less lag. Would buy this again for the cheap price, fifty elsewhere.Sincerely, iSklcndykid Bought October 7th. Passed away December 23rd. RIP.I didn\\'t really even use it because of the built in storage on my GS3. I had about 15 gb of music and movies on it, but only for when I was unexpectedly bored and without my zuneHd. On to the next brand I guess. Bought this to use with my Samsung HMX W300. Works well, good transfer speeds and comes with a normal size SD card to transfer if needed. I purchased this memory card to use in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it worked right out of the box. I haven\\'t had any issues with it at all and the transfer speeds have been excellent. I would highly recommend this or the 64GB version to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of your mobile phone. No complaints about this card. It\\'s much faster than what came with my Android devices and of course the capacity is nice. I have not experienced any issues indicating any defect. I bought this to go along with my new S4 that I purchased and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised at how much 32GB can get you on a phone!  I have pushed all of my apps to my SD card which has given me plenty of free room on my phone (a major detraction placed on the S4 especially).  I do notice that since moving most of my apps to the card, some load times and other features may take an extra second to really get going.  This may lead me towards going with more powerful SD cards in the future though I am assured this will work for all of my current needs. Fast transfer speed and got it for a great price. Used in my GoPro Hero 3 BE for many hours of recording and haven\\'t had an issue. Fits my camera perfectly and gets me about 2 hours of video at highest resolution! I love how easy it is to use and the capacity is perfect for my needs. holds a lot of memory. slides right into my car cam with no problem and easy to get out as well I recently bought a new phone with a lower storage amount and supplement it with this external SD card.  So far I haven\\'t had any issues with the phone recognizing and playing files from the card and being cheaper than anything comparable I would have found in a store, this works! I use this in my dash cam and it has worked perfectly for months in the hot sun and freezing cold. Use it on my tablet, and in an adapter for a usb flash drive on my pc.  So far, it\\'s stored movies, audio, books, pdf\\'s, etc.  Very happy with it.  Will be looking for a 64 soon. Very fast card in my SGS3.  Sandisk always makes quality cards.  I always get read/write speeds of at least 14MB/s and 22MB/s with this card (see my uploaded pic).  Card hasn\\'t given me any problems.  Reliable, fast, great price.  A++!!! I bought this for my Note 3. I put some of my data on it, and when I go to access my data, my data is there. It feels faster than the Note 3\\'s internal storage. Currently a very good piece of tech. I\\'ll update this review if anything new develops. Works great in my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S3. The only thing I found that didn\\'t work was trying to transfer my files using a USB MicroSD card reader. When I used this USB Reader it copied my files but the phone didn\\'t show them or couldn\\'t write to the card. I had to put the microSDXC card in the phone and copy my files the slow way using the USB cable. The card does run hot when copying files to or from it. That would be normal I assume with it being Class 10. Best bang for the buck IMO. I would buy another one if I needed it! YES Ayyy what can you say. It works. It used to have a delay for my phone recognizing it and all the data on it, but that may be a phone problem. Got it for $42.99 on black friday. Can\\'t knock it at all. *****FIVE STARS***** Don\\'t buy the ultra-cheap substitutes.  Some of them misstate their capacity.  I know that with SanDisk that I was going to get what I paid for.Sure enough, I did.  I use this in my phone to primarily hold music.  Transfer speeds have been more than acceptable and there have been no problems with file integrity. Works great in my Motorola Atrix 4G.  Consistently reliable - never any problems.  Will definitely purchase SanDisk again in the future.  Keep up the great work! I always purchase SanDisk memory cards.  I\\'ve never had any issues with them. I will continue to buy SanDisk products in the future. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB is just a storage device, so I don\\'t find that there will be many \"features\" to get excited about. That being said, it is advertised as having 30MB/s transfer speed, but this is misleading. It can READ up to 30 MB/s, however, and the packaging says this too; it writes at a slower rate. I used this for my phone (too much music) and had the stock 8 GB microSD that came with my phone. I had about 6.5 GB of data that I wanted to transfer back to my new microSD card, and this took about 30 minutes. If this were a strict transfer from my internal hard drive to an external it would be faster, but this is not such a connection. It lost a star because the transfer took so long, but in reality, I don\\'t expect to be transferring 6 + GBs of data anytime soon so this problem will be minimal for me. Other than that it works great, and I have not had any issues with the formatting or reading. I picked this up to slam into my s3 phone & it works greatif you are thinking about it for that just order it.If you have an s3, 64 gig is the largest card it will support This does not appear to work with the Samsung Galaxy S3.  It worked for a few weeks, then my phone started giving me \"Unexpected Unmounted SD Card\" error messages.  After a bit of searching, people seem to agree that the S3 and Sandisk micro SD cards do not work together. I put this into my new tablet before I went on a long road trip and I was able to watch a few movies off of it during a 12 hour bus ride. this card would not show 64 GB until i spent $60 on a card reader that supports sdxc, and after doing that, it is transferring at class 1 speed. i managed to get it formatted in FAT32 with 59 GB free for my Cowon J3, but it\\'s taking 10 hours to transfer 30 GB to it. i got a refund because this is not the service and quality i paid for. i just hope the music lists on my PMP when i turn it on tomorrow. i have it in the microSDXC slot of the AFT PRO-57U, which is connected to a Syba VIA VL800 USB 3.0 card. feel free to tell me i am doing it wrong and how to get class 10 speed.UPDATE: the transfer finished, but the data does not show in my Cowon J3, so the early versions that worked are gone. do not buy these for a device that is not SDXC specific because they have changed something in them. I purchased this card for my parent\\'s ASUS Transformer Tablet as a Christmas gift.  It installed with no issues and they love it.  I made the mistake of buying a no name SD card for my tablet (Motorola Xoom) previously and had to return it as my tablet didn\\'t recognize it.  The SanDisk brand is excellent quality.  I guess it just goes to show you, you get what you pay for.  The Amazon price is good.  Never again will buy cheap for a memory card. l went With the largest Capacity that my Camera Could handled.  Don\\'t skimp on memory .  You really do get what you pay for when it Comes to memory. All memory cards are not created equal.  I trust SanDisk. That\\'s why I\\'m willing to pay a little bit more. Bought this for my sons tablet, and it works fine. Sandisk has always been the leader in these flash memory cards, and has always been well worth the money. Fast, reliable, good brand name and customer service, top of line product. One thing to note is if you don\\'t have a high end device then you don\\'t need a class 10, a class 4 or 6 will yield you the same results. So keep that in mind. Seems to be fast. I use it in a Galaxy note for media storage, and it seems to move files as well as any USB stick. Ever since my SanDisk Ultra 64GB Micro SDXC card arrived, my life has been pure bliss.  Not only am I finally able to carry vast amounts of music, movies, and TV shows with me on my Samsung Galaxy Note 8, but my car now gets 14 more MPG, my landlord LOWERED my rent $300, I got a promotion at work, and my cat no longer sheds on the furniture! Not going to go on a rant about apple, but sure glad other phones allow these TINY slots that quadruples the memory. I drop and dragged tons of my music to the SD card and Android just finds it automatically and adds it to your list of music. The description on the Amazon page calls this a class 10 card with UHS-1 performance.  And while technically correct, (Full HD 1080p recording). You would expect more performance in the Sequential Write speeds.  It actually doesn\\'t even hit the class 10 speed unless you round up (9.951 MB/s).  I have 2 of these cards and they both report the same speed.  My Kingston 8GB SDHC Class 4 writes at 11.854 MB/s.  Now keep in mind the Sandisk beats the other cards in the random reads and writes.  So maybe the design for those faster random reads and writes causes the sequential writes to run slower than expected.

My last Micro SD card failed on me after a few months of use and I lost everything I had (nothing was recoverable...)This one, though seems to work perfectly as designed and I haven\\'t had an issue with it yet.Five stars because it does what I expect it to do and hasn\\'t failed me. Bought this 64gb micro SD for my galaxy S3 32gb smart phone.  Not only did it increase the size of my memory greatly,  the speed is noticeably better then the 16gb unit that came with my old DROID X smartphone.  I\\'ve put a thousand songs,  many pictures,  moved many apps to this storage unit and still have many gigs left both on my main phones memory and  memory card.  I will not purchase any smartphone that doesn\\'t offer SD expansion,  and look forward to the next step to 128gb or higher. These are great little cards and are very fast. The only thing I hate about microSD is that they are so dang small and the slots are spring loaded. I have lost a couple from them shooting across the room. I use the phone with this card in combination with an Eye-Fi Mobi card  to back up photos when I\\'m in the field. This MicroSD card made for a great upgrade for my Galaxy S 3\\'s storage capacity.  The card performs efficient read/writes and is giving my phone the kind of data storage I never thought I\\'d have.  If anyone is looking for enough storage space on their phone or tablet for a large amount of pictures, video\\'s, apps, or even document files, this may be exactly what you\\'re looking for. so fr it been great  i need it for my not 0. 2014 table  too bad it cost so much but  it is what it is I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  It works perfectly with no strange behavior, great speed, and the SanDisk name to back it up.  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend. I have only had this card for a month so far so good. Just got a new phone card no longer needed for that I am now using it for my camera, works great for that it is older Cannon Elph 5 MP and i get 1000 PICs wiith this card.. read writes speeds are great in both phone and camera. initially bought for a tablet, ended up using in my nikon camera. More storage, so I can\\'t complain! Sandisk has always been a high quality and dependable storage solution for my electronics. I added this to my Samsung S3 32gb phone and it works great. I can store most of my music for when i travel. I will nevery have to listen to the same thing on a signal trip. it works and it is just as fast as it is supposed, stores pictures as fast as I can click. I use this in an ASUS Android tablet. I\\'ve had no problems using it to transfer data between the tablet and PC. No trouble with storage errors either. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I cannot think of any complaints.  Other than it is very small......  Be very careful.  I am glad they put some red on this - makes it easier to find if you should drop it, for my note pro.  note pro says 29.71 GB available...the mysterious 2.29 GB black hole strikes again. Great fast storage. Works great as my Galaxy S4 storage card. You can always rely on sandisk products. Pay a little more sometimes, but worth it. Using this is my Surface Pro. Works great. &#128522; You have to Love Amazon its soooooo fast and gives you alot of space, and i love the free app it comes with you can control all the data on the device and sd card. just pop it in and go to settings. i reccomend this to everyone They work great and I haven\\'t had any issues with these cards.  I don\\'t like using the adapters, but in a pinch I also used this in my Canon HS300 camera for 1080 video and photos with no issue.  They have very fast read/write speeds and have been quite reliable so far for me. I have had this for about a year and it has worked flawlessly.  I use it add to the capacity of my MacBook Air and it has given me 50% more storage space.  Great product. I bought this memory card the day I received my Samsung Galaxy S4. It arrived in two days via Prime, plugged it in and formatted. It offers 59.45 GBs of usable space. Being that the card is Class 10, reads are super fast and writes are great. UHS-1 is, sadly, mostly only supported by DSLRs, so most smartphones and devices won\\'t take advantage of the super, super speed, but nonetheless, the card is fast.This card has lots of storage, affordable, transfers and reads fast. I\\'d recommend this for people who carry a lot of media, such as music and videos. i got this for my GoPro hero3 and so far its working great. The GoPro\\'s really eat up the flash memory so I bought 3 of the 32 GB models. i suggest that unless you are going on a particularly long scuba dive or adventure, you should get the 32 GB over the 64 GB cards as it spreads out the risk of any one card failure causing loss of all your videos. This Micro SD card works great. I even formatted it to FAT32 to use in my car for my TV headunit and have had no issues. Plus when i bought it it was down to 34.99 from 50.00. Great deal. I recommend setting an alert on www . camel camel camel . com so you get the best price. Card works great and I use it for our GoPro Hero 3 exclusively.  No issues at all while on a Yellowstone trip I wanted to increase the capacity of my tablet (Lenovo K1). To be sure it was at full capacity (call me paranoid), I checked it on my computer. Then, I moved some files on and off. This is one speed demon! I use this card in a Galaxy Note 10.1 and I have been very pleased with its performance.  It is noticeably faster than the class 4 card I replaced.  I use it for storing (and then watching) movies, and it plays them back with no observable buffering time.  It is also fast for writing photos or videos that I shoot using the camera on the tablet.  And the cost was among the lowest for cards of this storage size and speed class. Honestly I just don\\'t care anymore. If this thing works as intended then I suppose its fast to me. Get it. I really wouldn\\'t know how to rate a chip except to say that it works.  It is obviously slower than a USB 3.0 flash drive but it is working well in my Asus T100.  I use it as my D:\\\\drive for all data and scripts. Used in new smart phone, seems to be working well so far. Three months on the clock. Time will tell re durability. The only memory I use for most devices.  Have never had one fail, whether it be this microSDHC, compact flash, SD, flash drives, etc.  Great company. Got this card for my Surface RT, which, BTW is the worst tablet ever. No problems gets and it recognized it as soon as I put it in. I had been using a no name micro SD card in my phone for a while now. It was made by 3C, but it was 16GB and class 10 for really cheap. It actually didn\\'t give me any problems at all so would buy another one in a heartbeat.Anyways, my son wanted more games on his PSP (my PSP actually) so I used that 16GB card there with an adapter so I was in the market for a new card.I got this card because I trust the SanDisk brand, it was 32GB, and the price was cheaper than most. I plugged it in my phone and have not had a problem at all. I can\\'t tell you anything specifically positive, but that is okay in my book considering it means I don\\'t have anything negative to say either. No news is good news sometimes. Everything is smooth and there are no issues. I would buy this card again, recommend it to anybody who needs one, or buy a larger size from them when the time eventually comes. I bought this to expand the memory in my HTC Evo 4G LTE phone. Works great and the adapter is a nice touch. Purchased it for use on my Samsung Tab 2 as well as my Note 3.The msd card came with 3 possible formatting : NTFS / FAT /exFAT. The default is exFAT, and there seemed to be some comments saying that certain devices might not be able to read exFAT.Being the smart alec I am, i decided to format it to NTFS, assuming that my android devices will work with it. Tab2 was not able to read NTFS, and I had to reformat it back to FAT in order to get it work.Subsequently, I tried using those USB-SD card reader (those that looks like a tiny usb drive)and realised that apparently the SD card formatting is too new, and it simply will not register as 64GB, but can only read up to 32GB.Have not tried on Note 3 yet, but should work seeing that the technology is pretty on par. These ultra SanDisk memory cards work perfectly and for photo work in high pixel count cameras cycle extremely quickly. The Glad I purchased this item for use with my Samsung Galaxy s3, Im able to record video in HD or store almost anything you\\'d wanna have on your cell phone or etc.. Also fast .. Not much more I can say. I bought two.Would buy again and would recommend to u all I bought this an formatted it to FAT32 so I can use it in a devices that say they only allow 32GB card.  To do this you must find a program that will format card above 32GB into FAT32.  Windows will not format anything 32GB and higher in FAT32, so try this site for a program to do it in:  [...] I have recently purchased a Samsug Galaxy tablet. The SanDisk 32 Gb. Memory Card was an excellent addition to the already powerful tablet PC. I use this with my Go Pro Hero 3 Black edition and it works great!  Get it! Buy it! Its definitely worth it! No comment - bought for a friend.  No comment - bought for a friend  No comment - bought for a friend. Works awesome in my galaxy s3. Fast as could be and so much storage for music and pictures. Copys music in record time! Love the price and the product. I bought it for my wife\\'s Samsung Galaxy SIII.  I wanted something reliable so she can store music, videos, photos.I do recommend it to family and friends. Using it on a Canon 6D. No camplains at all. Really fast access. The adapter itself is not at same level, even though. Bad connection, had to use a previous adapter that I already had. I use SanDisk SDHC cards in my Nikon cameras. I am using this one in a SANSA ZIP CLIP which is an MP3 player.  I am very happy.Cons:  none that I can think ofPros: Fast memory, small form factor, and excessively inexpensive ($18 for 32GB) Perfect for our GoPro.  We haven\\'t &#34;maxed&#34; it out yet so I\\'m not sure how much video it will hold but we\\'ve been using it for a while now & haven\\'t had any issues with it getting full fast. This is a great little card. No problems. I haven\\'t done any benchmarking but everyday use is quick and flawless. Quick and easy -- just insert into SD slot and gives you about 32 GB of external storage.  I like it. Great card at a great price.  Hard to believe something so small could hold so much data.  I got this to use with my new MacBook Pro with a &#34;reduced profile&#34; adaptor.  The adaptor didn\\'t fit so well, but works great in my raspberry pi.  The card I just use as a normal one for now. I have no issues with this card, and my phone now boots much faster than before with my old 8gb class 4 card. Id say that this product is a steal! Now i am able to expand the storage size of my tablet to add more hd movies! i used it on my sony as15. been using it for almost a month now and i have yet to encounter any problem I put this in my tablet to store pictures and video. It does alot better than the class 4 I was using. Becuse I already had it in my junk drawer. This super micro SD card was required for the Sony Action Cam that I bought for use with my Phantom quad copter. Super small and therefore easy to misplace. I like my CF cards I use for my cameras because you can hold on to them better. I like sandisk products as that\\'s all I use. Price was right, shipping quick, Class 10 card for HD video in my GoPro.Hard to rate it since memory cards are pretty much memory cards. Nothing jumps out as excellent so that is why 4 of 5. I\\'ve gotten four of these for both of my Nikon D7000\\'s and have had little bit of an issue with the adapter cards being out of spec and sticking in the Nikon Camera SD Slots, and one of my card readers. Sure enough, i sanded one down carefully and it fit perfectly.Performance wise, these things scream over regular Class 10 or Class 6 cards and perform nearly excellent. I cant complain other than I wish they were faster, but I\\'m not getting that for a while at $23 per card. This memory is the right price and it worked right from the start.I think this is a good deal and good memory.Works fine in Note 2 Awesome! So much space, and it works with my phone, all i could ask for! Comes in extremely handy. Thank you SanDisk! I bought this for my Samsung GS4 and it is working quite well. I have had it for several months without issues. I do not know how it performs vs what is advertised but for my purposes I don\\'t care as much. It seems to load quickly on my phone as well as saving files. Super fast and lots of storage! I can fit months worth of Music, App\\'s and eBook\\'s on it with room to go! SanDisk does not disappoint, this is exactly as described, arrived on time and is plenty of storage for all my photos, music playlists, and still leaves room for movies as well. I had an old Class 4 Kingston card in my phone and the thing just dragged when transferring music or photos. I finally decided I had enough with Class 4 and went looking for a reliable Class 10 card. This SanDisk does the trick. Now music and photo transfers fly like the wind. I can move over a FLAC album in about 30 seconds to my Droid Razr MAXX with no interruptions like I had on my Class 4 card. I bought this card as an addition to my 32 GB Galaxy Note 3. I have well over 32 GB that I use for music with scads left over for apps and movies. You may never need this much space, but some of you are like me and we WANT this much space. With my 3.0 USB the transfer speeds are very adequate. Can\\'t wait for the 256 GB ;) This memory has proved to be quick and reliable.  I\\'m using it as a second drive in my Win 8 tablet, but might swap it to my camera where the transfer speed would be appreciated more often. stil not getting the write speed as I need, but considering the cost /capacity /speed it is a good card! Bought two separately.1) One was a frustration free package one was apparently a frustrating package. Both came in similar packages stuffed in large yellow envelopes. Don\\'t really see the difference between the frustration free and frustrating one. The frustrating one just required scissors, no real attempt of making it a &#34;greener&#34; package was really attempted (that I could tell), nor did it matter since it was put into a giant envelope anyway.2) One was sent USPS, the other ParcelPool. I\\'ve had bad experiences before with ParcelPool (as have many people apparently) but I guess Amazon gave them an earful because it actually arrived on time this time. The &#34;tracking&#34; for ParcelPool is still a huge joke though.3) Actual product: it\\'s a MicroSD card, it does exactly what it\\'s supposed to do. No problems with it. memory cards best in world. The memory card completely corresponds to the description. I am happy, my smartphone is happy, my tablet is happy. amazon thanks It\\'s been a month now with this SDCard in my phone.  I transfer an average of 3GB of data to and from the device per week.  The SDCard is holding just fine.  Where most tend to crap out or cause problems, this has yet to do it. This is the real deal. There are fakes out there and this is NOT one of them. This shipped directly from SanDisk Corporation! When purchasing from Amazon and the seller is different you never know what you may receive and they (the seller) are not always aware of fakes so you have to contact SanDisk to provide the serial code number off the card or send a pic to them so they may authenticate it. It\\'s nice to not have to do that for a change! Checked the partition and it\\'s correct. Also confirmed this card ir read by LG Optimus G Pro on AT&T network. Sandisk is the premier brand in flash memory and this card came at a good price. Speeds are fast enough to work inside of my 1080p dashcam and has been running consistently for a few weeks now. Good brand, speeds as advertised, and reliable so far. No complaints. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . no issues till date so happy Plugged into my new Surface Pro and works great!  No issues or hassle.  Good price and low cost for adding additional storage. Great little card. Will allow 1080p recording on my note 3 phone. Frustration free packaging is genius. Make sure your device supports the high capacity card before ordering. I got this to expand the storage in my Microsoft Surface and it works great. I can quickly transfer data on to it and then pop it out and put it into my desktop or phone. Definitely recommend if you need big storage for your mobile device. Bought 1 to expand capacity on a Galaxy S3, and another to expand capacity on a Galaxy S4. Have used the one for the GS3 for about a year, and the one for the GS4 about a month. Both have worked without any problems, and are fully recognized by the devices. The GS3 was rooted a couple of months ago and is running LiquidSmooth. Still no issues. Very good card. I highly recommend SanDisk. Works as it should and have not had any issues with it so far. I also was able to purchase it here for much less then Wal-Mart. I purchased a 64Gb Samsung SD card to expand the memory of the phone.However, I frequently get a message that the card has been removed or is recovering.Sometimes the problem clears itself, other times I have to reboot the phone.It also says \"MTP application will restart to prepare SD Card\". It then starts listing the restarting/recovering SD card.I eventually replaced it with a Sandisk 16gb microsd \"HD\" card from Walmart and it is operating fine.I have been reading a lot about people having issues with the 64gb sandisk cards and the Galaxy S4.I wish I had done more research before wasting $50 on what I thought was a good buy! Works as expected. This product has added 32GB memory to my Samsung Galaxy S3. Love it. It adds so much more memory to your device. Love this micro sd card, but love the fact that I was able to buy it at such a great price! The only thing is if you use this product on Andiod you must format .  Windows machines don\\'t seem to supot FAT32  .  winwods machines will open files but the format program on Win only formats NTFS and EXFAT  which is limting because Andriod uses FAT32. Perfect card.  I have it in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and its fast.  no delay in pictures/video writing, and I think I may get a second just to keep on hand. 32 GB Micro SD chip. If this is the size and memory amount you desire, this memory card has never failed or had errors on me. 5 stars for that and being the cheapest I could get at the time. Fast little memory card. Affordable, good quality. Will be quadrupling my storage space on my device. I never seem to have enough of these Used this in my S4 and in my new S5. Transfer speed is good and it is still performing well after almost a year. I haven\\'t been disappointed with a SanDisk product yet. I used this upgraded card in my Razr Maxx HD and have been nothing but pleased with it. I haven\\'t even come close to filling the entire card. I got it mostly because I keep my entire music library on my phone, about 5 gigs of music. It\\'s a class 10 card so you won\\'t see any lag in pulling up files. Great card for the price. Overall, a great purchase with a reasonable price. I have bought 4 units and all working well in various devices This card is one of the fastest SD cards on the market. It works great for your Samsung Galaxy Note II. No issues with installation or device recognition. Highly recommended. I bought this for my Dell Venue Pro 8 64 GB so that it would boost the Memory to 128 GB.  It is super easy to use, great shipping and I got it very quickly. Got this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Recognized it immediately. Seems to work fast for the pics and videos I\\'ve taken. No complaints. The price on these things fluctuates quite a lot. I would recommend to use a price tracker (camel camel camel) on this before purchasing or at least pay attention to the price a couple of days of purchase. The price had dropped by fifteen dollars after it shipped. Amazon\\'s awesome customer service refunded the difference without any trouble. Thanks! Installed this in my Galaxy S 3, no issues, put in, formatted and started taking photos, everything work fast and as expected. Was expecting a better and faster, more efficient product, and was not disappointed. Replaced a standard type 32 GB card and this does work remarkably better. Pleased with the purchase. Purchased for my new ASUS Tablet TF701T and as always, SanDisk is reliable!  I\\'ve never had one fail in 25 yrs. Very pleased. As usual SanDisk is the best manufacturer for usb and micro SD cards. I\\'m using this one for my GoPro Hero 3 Black edition and it works really good. I also compared the specs with other Micro SD brands and saw that this one is the best among other micro SD cards I\\'ve been using this  in my Sony TSX300 camera and have had no problems with quality, speed or function.  S far it works great.  Much cheaper here than at Best Buy Well my sister and I got new phones.  So I didn\\'t want to use our old memory cards.  And from what I could tell this product represented the best combination of speed and price.  Plus I\\'m familiar with SanDisk brand.  They have been working perfectly for us for about a month now and I don\\'t expect that to change. Perfect.Get the 32gb. I put this in my Galaxy Note II and put a bunch of music and PDFs on it.  I also used it to save videos and photos.  It worked well for about 2 months then, on Christmas Day (today), it said that there was an error reading the card and the card was now blank.  My phone no longer recognizes the card and even putting it into its adapter and sticking it in the SDHC reader of my laptop doesn\\'t work.If this is SanDisk Quality, then I am not impressed.  I am going to have to deal with their warranty replacement but I\\'d rather have a refund than get another card that might fail after 2 months... SanDisk were the first Memory cards I came across years ago.  I think they hold up very well against the competition.  They are inexpensive and do the job.  I am a huge Kingston fan, but the price of this card was too hard to pass up.I currently have it in my phone for Photo & Video storage.  So far, no complaints. By far the best MicroSD card I\\'ve ever used. It\\'s precise, fast and secure, what more can you ask for? Whether it was photos, music or even a few movies, this recorded, played and transferred data flawlessly. Very highly recommend Do not buy, card failed on the third usage.  Kicker not to my favoris you only have about 2 months to return this card for a full refund.Then, it\\'s a pro rated rated deal when you send it back to Amamzon inLexington, KY.The failed card was in a GoPro White Edition. Needless to say, a camera thatwas purchased for summer outdoor usage in November is going to sit for quite awhile before you have time to get your money back.  Card sat all winter and failedtowards the end of April.  6 months lag to get a decent, even pro rated refund.Out of all the items I bought from Amazon this is my only bad experience.64 gigs crammed on a tiny micro SD card is too much.  I\\'ll stick with thesmaller 32 gigs until this technology is meant to last.Refund Update, once again Amazon did the right thing anbd refunded full purchase pricefor the dead 64 gig.  Amazon is where I shop for 2 reasons.  1. I live 50 miles frombig box stores and 2. they ALWAYS make things right with no muss ...no fuss.I replaced the dead card with Amazon brand Micro 32 gig SD micro card.I have purchased Amazon branded SD cards before and they work just as good as any.Not to mention the cost savings. So far have not had any problems with the card.  Our movies have been great.  Beautiful color. Very clear and bright pictures. great price and just what i needed i would recomend this product i think all scan disk products are good I slipped this into my smartphone. Lots of space for photos, and movies on the go at a great price. No problems encountered and seems perfectly compatable with the S4...  Can\\'t even tell when you are using something off the card or off the phones internal memory.Note that up to 32GB it requires the HC cards,  from there to 64GB it requires the XC version.Happy with this purchase so far. perfect addition to the Microsoft Surface i purchase for my daughter.  quick and has worked well so far.  SanDisk is a reputable brand. looking for a good memory card then this is it. Its fast and it works flaw less with my Samsung tab 3 Works perfectly in my new phone. Great price and it was delivered on time and in good shape. I\\'ve never had any trouble with SanDisk, so I\\'d recommend it to anyone. Good product, no problems. I have this installed in my Samsung Galexy III. works well even in super HD video. At the time, this was one of the best you can get.  Even now, at UHS-1, you will be doing better than the older, slower chips.  The form factor is handy for products which can take the Micro SD. It does what it is supposed to do and is pretty fast.  Sandisk is a great company when it comes to flash memory This Micro SD card is solid and has a great performance. It\\'s really a fast reading SD Card, I would say 4 times faster than any previous cards I had in the past. Once I placed the card in my phone, and I turned it on, you could see the difference. Every application I have in my cell phone that is in my SD card, works really flawlessly. A great product, very solid performance. Sandisk is far away the best memory card ever.I used to this brand because it never fails.The future of this kind is eternal. I get randomly error messages with my nokia808, \"disk error-\" and the card stops working, its so, so sad.. I bought a cheap 8gb micro sd class 4 that works better than this :( Does the job. No complaints so far. Will have to buy a couple of more since I plan on using them to store my dive recordings from hero pro 2 with the adapter. Works perfect on Samsung Galaxy S4... memory is fast and didn\\'t get any unmount problem mentioned on previous reviews... my model number is GT-I9500 and version is 4.2.2 This is big and fast for me. I prefer having this side so I wont run out of space and the speed of 32+/- is all I need anyways.  Highly recommend it. All is fine with this memory. It works very well with my Smartphone, very fast communication with my pics and videos. Good purchase!!! The product arrived on time too. I wish I could say this card was great. Been waiting for it for around a year and a half whilst using the 64GB one (also SanDisk) which never gave me issues; sadly I lost it. This card confused the heck out of me. I used it on my S4 and first off, it wouldn\\'t recognize it. Tried it on my gf\\'s S4 and same problem.Apparently it comes formatted as exFAT and thought maybe reformatting it as FAT32 would solve the problem. Well I thought it did since my phone finally recognized it upon inserting it. A new problem arose, though. I started taking pictures to try it out and odd thing was some of the pictures became corrupted. Not even viewable on the phone seconds after taking them. Some worked, others not.Later on, I restarted my phone for some reason or other. A while later I wanted to check the pictures again and, surprise surprise, everything was gone. I\\'d find out later that every time I restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted. Tried it on my gf\\'s phone and same thing happened.Tried reformatting again as FAT32 using GParted (couldn\\'t hurt) and it just throws errors upon starting the write sequence.Too bad I can\\'t return it as I had it shipped to me in Guatemala. So that\\'s $119 down the toilet. I have to buy a new one now, but I think I\\'ll go for the new Samsung EVO ones (although they don\\'t offer a 128GB model as of this writing - bummer). I got this card for my sony action cam, and it is the best memory card, it work fast and process eveything fast, I recomend this I use this on my Galaxy S3 and Sony Action Cam, and it works perfectly, never had any issues with it and i find that for any action cam this is a pretty solid sorage ammount. It may be that the internal SD slot of the 2012 Mac Book Air is not too fast perhaps?  I am very disappointed that I can only achieve 4-9 MB/s of write/read speed.  Makes me remember speeds of 5 years ago.  Again, this may be the computer\\'s fault, but I am not too happy... I am very happy with this micro sd, I\\'m using a galaxy note 10.1 and the truth is very fast, copies files quickly. Very nice product. The memory works perfectly and it is exactly what i was waiting for. I recommend it 100% As I just mentioned, it is both fast and efficient.  After several months of use in both my laptop and 7 inch Galaxy Tab 2, it has displayed exceptional speed and no loss of data.  I highly recommend this card for use in computing devices and/or tablets. as fast as amazon prime 2 day shipping...its rocking inside my samsung galaxy s4! plug and play fun!now i have all the space i need with all the speed i want! No problems with the card what so ever. Bought it for a new tablet just plugged it in and started to move files to it in a second. This is my favorite memory card brand. I have mani more in other devices. Also very reliable for keep&iacute;ng your data safe Fast, great storage. We used this SD card for a new Samsung Galaxy S5. Works like a dream. Well formatted and fast. I would recommend this product to anyone who need a high gb sd card. The added on sd adapter is a nice plus and comes in handy for pc transfers. The ability of something so small to hold so much information is somewhat overwhelming but true.I use this one in my DOD DashCam and it works great. Highly recommend to all. Very fast transfer speeds and it feels like it is very good build quality. Great price too and would recommend. Got for my Samsung Galaxy Tab2 7.0 . Plugged it in and it works.That is about all there is to it. So far its been fine, no problems other than when installed phone only read 59.45GB instead of the 64 GB, thats the reason I\\'m only giving it 4 stars.  If anyone can give me a answer why it only read 59 instead of the 64 please let me know! Very quick and no problems what so ever. A great storage platform and works great in both my Lenovo tablet and my Samsung phone. I would recommend this to anyone =) Bought it for my tablet.  it works well, and it has been working now for about 6 months.  I have no complaints. I bought a bunch of these for many many hours use with hi-res video cameras and every one has been fast and flawless.Plus, if you get more than one like me, you might want a way to keep track of which is which. Notice there is a small blank area in the red to the right of the SanDisk name. You can write a number there with a fine tip marker. Don\\'t try that on one of those solid black chips! Wonderful card and performs fast and efficient. I use it with my Samsung Galaxie S3 with no problems. Love the hjgh caparcity it offers and reliability of SanDisk I cannot say if it\\'s the SD card or the phone, but google sez it\\'s the phone. Put your MP3s on this card for your Galaxy S3, and the result is a jumble of corrupted files. Yep, that\\'s what I got. So, in fairness to SanDisk, I gave this card 4 stars, and a suggestion to y\\'all out there, get the 16gb card for your S3 instead. Previously purchased two ADATA microsd cards one which never worked and one which failed on the second boot.So far no problems with tht sansdisk chip. The advertisement calls this card a \"class 10\" card however I was not able to get \"class 10\" speeds with this card. SD cards seem to be MUCH faster at read/write then microSD cards. I get about 10MB/s write speed when copying a file to my SD card through my phone USB cable. I get the same transfer rate when in an adapter. These small memory cards seem to be very limited on their write speed. Also, this card did heat up some when transferring to it for a long period of time continuously but not too bad...just warm. The read speeds seem to cap out at about 18MB/s but I did see 25MB/s on small files. One thing to note, and this may be by design for this particular card but, this card is super fast when transferring small files but slow at big files so you\\'ll see slower write speeds the longer you write to it with larger files whereas smaller files zip along one at a time at that 10MB/s. I was getting 8.6MB/s when writing a 4.6GB movie file to this card. All in all, this is an excellent card and beyond worth the money for what you get. I love it for my EVO 4G LTE and my previous phone the EVO 4G. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it did not perform as advertised at 30MB/s. However, if you are thinking of getting this memory card for an Android phone and don\\'t want to pay big bucks, this is your card. Stop reading and buy it, I\\'m glad I did. This is an excellent product. I have no complaints or issues with the card. It\\'s the perfect size for my cameras. ...to have both the micro and the adapter in the same package. I only had to buy ONE package to get the items I needed for my Smartphone and my digicam.  I replaced the 2 gig micro in my phone with the 32 gig one, then reformatted my 2 gig micro to be used in the adapter for my camera, then uploaded photos to my laptop using the adapter.I would have given it 5 stars, but the adapter stopped working after only 2 months! Truthfully, though, I don\\'t know if it\\'s because the product is defective, or if I just handled it too much or incorrectly. So I feel 4 stars is fair. Purchase this for my GoPro Hero3. It was absolutely perfect and fair in price. I might just purchase another one(1). Purchased this for my phone.  It was easy to install and format for my phone.  It arrived on time and packaging was appropriate. No issues so far.  SanDisk is a good brand so hopefully it will last and be durable.  We\\'ll see.  Recommended. I bought this for my camera, which had a 720p video recording option.  Everything works just fine with the card and its adapter. After purchasing three of these (one for myself and two for gifts to others) I read reviews that said they sometimes just quit, and it\\'s difficult or impossible to recover data.  I have only been using my own card for 2-3 weeks, but it hasn\\'t failed yet.3/27/13 after having this in my phone for almost 4 months, the phone started chirping every few seconds, telling me it was either mounting or unmounting a card.  The SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card apparently just decided to fail.  Thank goodness I only had info for one small app on it, and only need to access it about once a week, so it\\'s not real critical.  Thanks to Amazon\\'s 30 day return policy though, I will probably just have to eat the cost of this one.  Unfortunately, I read the other bad reviews about this product after I had already purchased mine (2 of them, but my wife\\'s hasn\\'t failed YET).  My advice is to stay clear of this product, and maybe SanDisk in general. I didn\\'t realize what small memory I had on my old phone T-mobile My Touch 3G Slide! I mean the thing was so slow and not accepting downloading stuff anymore! I figured later than the memory might be small. Sure it was! I looked up for a SanDisk memory card on Amazon and ordered one! Was surprised it was much cheaper than I had seen in a store! Installed it in my phone, worked like a champ! I can still use my phone for different downloads with that much memory! Upon inserting my HC 16GB card from a Motorola Doid X into the Galaxy S3 my music would play very chopped and sometimes the files would not work at all.  This card not only cleared that problem up but allows me to put my whole music collection on the phone!  No complaints so far, does its job. I use this card in my 7&#34; iGo GPS. The GPS came with a couple of GB onboard, but that was quickly used up by WinCE 6 and that GPS software. Since this device also plays MP3s, I wanted more space.I read the meager documentation that came with the device to see if it could handle a 16GB card. I was pretty sure it would handle an 8GB card, but one never knows with these ever-changing specifications. Unfortunately, the documentation for this device was meager and written in pidgin English.OK, I\\'ll buy it and give it a try. At worst, I swap out my 8GB card from a different device, which hopefully will handle the 16GB card.Well, too make a long story short (too late for that, eh?), the 16GB card works just fine. I put a bunch of my MP3s on the card, put it into the device, and sure enough, it recognizes and plays them.So, pretty much a done deal. For the price, for the ease of use, for the name brand, I recommend this little card. Stay away from no-name-brand flash memory and get a quality Sandisk. I\\'ve owned dozens of their USB flash drives, CompactFlash, SD and microSD cards over the years and they just WORK!as for this particular model, i have the 64gb microSD in my Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 tablet and a 16gb microSD my Galaxy Note 2 smartphone...popped \\'em in and the devices recognized them no problem. I can drag/drop copy/paste files from internal storage to the cards without issue, on the fly or plugged into my computers. i always recommend Sandisk to anyone looking to expand their storage capacity. It reaches read speed of about 24MB/s and write speed of about 18MB/s at optimal situation.Other than the speed, everything is fine. I\\'d like to say the color is quite a good thing, because MicroSD could be so small that you put it away for a few seconds it will easily disappear. With the bright read and light grey color, it is much easier to find, because it will not blend into common background.Also, the quality looks good, not like some of the MicroSD cards, this is a \"unibody\" design that you cannot tell from appearance that where is the circuits. The SD card adapter come with it is in quite good quality too.In summery, good design, good quality, not too satisfying speed. It will be a judgement call to say if it worth it or not. But to me I can totally go with it. I\\'ve tried other cards going back to when Compact Flash cards ruled and every single time I wind up coming back to SanDisk.  Why, because they won\\'t certify a card at a certain speed unless it can sustain that speed and every single SanDisk product I\\'ve ever owned has lasted, and lasted, and lasted.  I have QUIT using SanDisk products because it just didn\\'t make sense to keep using them (256mb and 512mb thumbdrives and flash cards... they still work... REALLY slowly... but they still work fine... but what the heck do you use them for?) but the only times I have ever had a SanDisk fail I could trace the failure back to something other than a fault in the SanDisk product soooo... I buy SanDisk because I ALWAYS get my money\\'s worth. Using this in a security camera that I have mounted outside. It does the job of recording the pictures and video. The first one failed and had issues, but this second one seems to be working well. I purchased this for my grandson for his tablet. I actually purchased 2. He loves his games so I wanted to be sure he had plenty of space to save everything he wanted. They must be working, I\\'ve heard no complaints. Excellent, quality item. Bought this as an upgrade from having an 16 GB for my android phone, not that I need all the extra space but it\\'s nice to have handy. This will accommodate more pictures and videos that I take with my phone and among other things without having to worry about running out of space, for now. Packaging was good. Arrived on time, having Amazon Prime, that\\'s something you don\\'t have to worry about. It works great and added more memory for my LG phone.  Sandisk brand is very trust worthy.I recommend it highly. marvelous, I just fixed it into my camera and it automatically recognized it. great storage for my camera to use This memory card works in both my Nook and my Canon camera.  I chose this disk because it will hold lots of pictures.  It was shipped earlier than expected. This a great card with lots of storage for the money. Don\\'t hesitate in buying this, it\\'s a steal for the amount of storage you get. good card of high quality material, nice design, new model. product brand name is famous n reliable. recommended, for good price... Use this on my phone to watch HQ videos or run apps off of and unlike lower class (non HC) cards this one never stutters. after 3 months would not read at all. Used all sorts of card readers and computers and internals went completely dead. Strange for a product from this company but i guess it happens. May not happen to you but since it\\'s a high capacity would that mean it\\'s more susceptible to becoming corrupted? Would not buy again. (maybe a 16gb) For $20 I can\\'t complain about those speeds too much.  I put this little guy into a super mini MicroSD reader to stick into my truck stereo for MP3 storage.  I use a USB3 memory card reader to populate the card with music, and my truck stereo seems happy with it. I use it in my Note2. It does what it\\'s supposed to do, and extends the storage capacity for this great phone! Purchased this as an add on memory for a new android tablet.  San Disk has a good reputation and I have never had one fail.  Purchased the Ultra for the speed and was purchased at a good price.  I would recommend this item to anyone who needs SD micro memory. No complains here.  Awesome cards with great performance.  No degradation in speeds so far as well as no bad sectors. I have not utilized the card as much as I had hoped I would, so I cannot comment too much on the speed, but my tablet (Asus Transformer Infinity) certainly has plenty of space on it now. We have 3 of these and so far it is my favorite microsd card, fast and so far no problems. I ran several tests both on my computer, and my phone it wrote at 6MB and read at about 6 to 10 depeneding on its mood. I bought this to replace a generic 32GB class 10 card that I lost (so dang small i droped it and could not find it. that Card actual wrote at 11 to 12MB and read at 20MB. I went with sandisk because my phone came with a class 2 that performs more like a class 6. What a waste of time. Refunded this item The product shipped fast and actually came in a few days early. I read about some people having problems with this card. When I got it, first thing I did was format it. Also make sure your device is compatible with SDHC cards. I have had no problems. Very fast read/write speeds. A little over 29 GB actually available for storage. I am pleased. Lasted about 8 months of daily use in my Android phone. But yesterday it stopped performing writes and then failed altogether. While it was working, reads were incredibly fast and writes were pretty good as well. Yeah. Ultra Hot. I could not get any of my devices to recognize this card. When I finally was, using a USD reader, I tried to format it. It wouldn\\'t format and burned my fingers when I removed it. Others have also posted this. Maybe they are not all bad, but many are. Perhaps they are counterfeit, I don\\'t know. But the hassle of having to return it isn\\'t worth the $10 you may save. i thought only a 32 gb would work in my 32gb asus pad but this works great in it...i wanted more space an this made it easier to put on vids an way more pics I was looking for expanding memory of my Galaxy Note 3, so I bought this one. This is class 10 micro SD card. Good enough speed for the smart phones. The best way to upgrade the memory of the phone. When I needed more VIDEO capacity for my Canon camera, the Sandisk 32 GB Micro Card (with included Adapter) was EXACTLY the right tool for the job !!I\\'ve had several SanDisk Memory Cards in the past, with never a glitch of any kind.Highly recommended ! I got this to use in my mother\\'s digital camcorder. It offered good value and with the adapter it insures that the card can be used anywhere. My mom was very happy with the extra capacity this card provided her to film my niece and nephew. The micro SD card was extremely fast.  Writing and read files were very fast even on a slow USB 2.0 interface.  Mechanically, the card is tight in the adapter.  Needs a screw driver to get it back out of the adapter.  Tried on another two adapters with the same results, tight fit.  If user plan to use this as a normal size SD card, it is an excellent card.  If one plan to switch between &#34;phone&#34; (micro SD card) and camera (normal size SD card), then the tight fit might be a problem.  Vender service was excellent.  shipment was faster than expected.  Would buy it again even with the tight fit.  It was an excellent value for a very fast card (camera can shoot burst mode without slowing down to write to card). Received it as promised. Inserted it into tables and was acknowledged that it is there.Guess it will work as expected also. I put it in my tablet and so far nothing to complain about. Will see how long this one can last. SanDisk makes some great memory chips for a decent price. I can\\' recommend no names brands because of their error frequency. works great so far, but gopro filled the card pretty quick recording at 1080p. So I got a 64GB a week later. I had to replace my other 32G MSD Card. Was not aware of the Card Speed issue and as a result started loosing video and pics from the card as they became corrupted. Did a little research and found out the card write speed was the issue. Did not make sense. But replaced the card and yes it works. Have not lost a pic or a vid since. Love this 32gb micro sd card. I put it in my Samsung Galaxy Note phone. I just returned from a 3 day trip where I used it as my camera/video recorder. I kept it on HD quality the whole time. No problems at all. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating was because it actually only had 29gb of space instead of 32. If that is the norm then please excuse my ignorance! I\\'ve never had a problem with Sandisk memory products (I use their &#34;ultra&#34; compact flash for my other camera), and this one is cut from the cloth. A great product with no problems... I will continue to demand Sandisk! How can you review a SanDisk card?  It works.  It stores pictures and other items on my phone.  Zero problems with it. this card is use in a galaxy S4; read and write speed is very good. the card comes ready to use out of the box I use this in my Galaxy Tab 3 It is great and I have not had any issues with it. Ordered several of these as they are much cheaper then at Best Buy. Use in my GoPro and they work great. I prefer several 32GBs over 64GBs just in case they do get corrupted you aren\\'t losing as much data. Great memory card! Got this on one Amazon\\'s daily deals at a terrific price! Getting ready to upgrade my cell phone and want to have a larger capacity memory card ready to go. This is just what I needed! Works fine my Virgin Mobile HTC EVO V. The phone didn\\'t recognize it at first, but after formatting it\\'s all good. 32 GB on top of my 16GB from my Samsung  S4.  Memory Card with adapter included.  Fit exactly on my phone.  Price was lower than buying in another phone store. I got this to upgrade my surface pro 2\\'s storage and it works nicely, what do I store on it? Bunch of MP3\\'s and games on steam.It works well, the games run fine, boot pretty quick, the one issues I had was installing the games, sometimes the card would vanish from the drive and I\\'d have to pop it in and out to get it to go again, however I feel like that could be software related as nothing like that happened while playing a game.Best idea is to install the game on the surface, move the files over manually to the card, &#34;tell steam to uninstall the game&#34; to erase it from the list, then hit install, point it to the folder on the card, then it\\'ll spot the files, download only a few things and bam, it works.About the card itself, I wouldn\\'t rely on multitasking off this thing, as it\\'s not meant for that- as in if you\\'re playing music off this card, do not install a game at the same time. It\\'s fast at 1 thing, not many. The card was working great. I own quite a few for several of my devices. One that I bough in 2012 suddenly died. I went to the SanDisk website and did a chat support. The Tech tried some quick troubleshooting and after about five minutes asked for my info for an RMA. The process was quick and easy. Like I said, this one suddenly died, no idea why. Luckily I didn\\'t have anything important on it at the time. This is the only one I\\'ve ever had fail, and like I said, the RMA process was a breeze. I really like these cards and the customer service was great. For reference, I run these cards in a Samsung Galaxy SII (hercules) - 32 gb, Motorola Droid (sholes) - 16 gb, Motorola Droid 3 (solana) - 32 gb, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2012) (GT-N8013) -32 gb, it was the Note one that failed. I also have a GoPro but I run the golden SanDisk cards in that, but they are twice the price! I will continue to buy these cards regardless of this isolated incident. I mean, its obvious lies, this whole 64GB thing.. you get maybe 60 if you are lucky..Seems to work ok so far. I take lots of pics with my phone (Samsung 4S) and this helps free up space on my phone. I\\'ve not had any issues with it so far. exactly what I neededTook the old 32 GB card out of my Samsung Galaxy S4 to put in my digital recorder so I bought this new 64 GB card for the phone.As advertised, very fast and stable (I try to transfer as many of my apps to external media on the phone to free memory on the phone) and I have not had one problem as of yet.Highly recommended We always come straight to Amazon for our memory card needs, and SanDisk is one of the reliable names in this category.  Lots of usable memory for minimum cost outlay so there is no downside to this product. Max out storage on your compatible devices! This is the best Class 10 MicroSD card I own. I have compared it to my other cards and it out performs all other cards I have. It came with a SD to microSD card converter which is a nice plus. This card come pre-formatted to work with Android devices and Windows devices. Can\\'t get much easier than that.Great card + fast shipping = no complaints Would recommend friends. Worked as expected and transfer is speedy. Always a fan of SanDisk where they make they product quality. Purchased for school district.  I haven\\'t heard any complaints (which I would) so I can only assume that everything is okay. This product is great my phone doesnt lock up anymore. I was wondering what a class 10 was and i found out that it means it runs faster than the normal black micro sd card (most are a class 1 or 2) that your smart phone comes with..this card makes a difference in how fast i can get on the internet to... Before purchasing this I had a SanDisk 16GB Class 2 microSDHC. Needless to say, I didn\\'t see the need in purchasing one of these. Then I began to read how Class 10 cards really do process recordings faster and records pictures faster. I didn\\'t believe it, so I put it to the test. Using it in my Samsung Galaxy sIII, I installed it and recorded videos, took pictures, and played music on it. I also downloaded PDFs for work and other documents to it. In every test, it was far faster than any other class, and you can tell a difference between the classes. To close, I would just say don\\'t settle for a lower class because it\\'s cheaper. Wait for these to go on sale (because you know as well as I do that they will) and purchase one then. There is no reason to get a card in a lower class. Great price. Fast speed class 10. with adapter. I like the color. It\\'s a memory card not much to go wrong. Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Legend phone so I can store all my pictures and videos, works like a charm. they work great with my phonei think i may have to buy lots more of this productmaybe 64gb it is a very good product, we like the brand and we keeping buying it for our camares, phones, tablets... I can\\'t give that much feedback on this because I ended up returning it. I was looking for the ideal memory mircoSD card for a GoPro and found a better model. I did end up filming one event on this card, and it did pretty good. It did end up lagging after some time though, just briefly. Well known brand-name. High speed, good price, lots of storage space. Lots of uses.  I bought a micro adapter so I can use it as a flash drive for movies. I used this to upgrade the storage on my phones and tablet. Its simple, I get fast transfer speeds, it just simply works and works well. This is my go to card brand for reliability and performance. I\\'ve only had this Memory card for 3.5 weeks and it not only has recently started resetting, it intermittently loses contact with my Cell phone and the memory is lost, erasing everything on it!!!!!! Now I find out my return date has past and I\\'m stuck with a peice of s*** memory card that I can\\'t do a damn thing about! Thanks a lot for nothing! I will never buy direct from here again!Also, I didn\\'t realize I was supposed to have an adapter too? wow where the heck is that at??? This card does not work on droid razr phones. Whenever I try to transfer files on the card, it makes the phone freeze completely. I have tried every possibility to get this to work, but this type of card is worthless because it does not work due to its high capacity on phones. Every workaround I have tried to get this card to work, it still causes my phone to freeze. I am using this to add capacity to my Android powered HP Slate 7&#34; tablet, had to re-format to NTFS to work but then it worked great!  Note many devices will only work with up to 32 GB card only, check your specs before ordering i got this sd card for my trip to hawaii so i could gopro everything. gets about 4 hours of video at 1080hd. works great. no complaints. highly recommended. I bought one of the 32GB for my Galaxy S4, and another for my Canon T3i. It works no problem in it, detected and formatted out of the box.  SanDisk is one of the most reliable card manufacturers in my opinion. I\\'ve gone through and sold a lot of cheap/lesser SD cards throughout the years, and almost all manufacturer has their failures, but to date I haven\\'t had any issues with SanDisk. I\\'ve bought this same card for my wife and family members (everyone has the S4), and so far there\\'s been no issues. I use mine heavily everyday, new music and movies, and after 6-9 months haven\\'t had any failures.As far as speed goes, using `dd` on a USB3 card reader I recorded almost 14MB/s write speed and 33MB/s read speed. Making it by far the fastest Class 10 card I\\'ve had. They do sell &#34;Extreme&#34; versions of this card which are even faster, but most integrated devices won\\'t see the speed increase benefits. I bought the 64GB version of this card to increase the storage capacity of my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I use it to store pictures and video which I shoot with the phone.  I have never had any issues with the card keeping up to the 1080p video that the phone shoots.Speed as tested on my Galaxy S3 w/ SD Card Tester:Write: 9.6 MB/sRead: 24 MB/s A must have for those who listen to a lot of music on the go...wish they made a 128gb model. Bought this to expand my storage space on both my Galaxy S4 and a Surface tablet with Windows RT. Performed very well on both, transferring small files can take a while but I have no problems recording video in HD with my phone. Totally recommend it, and it\\'s the largest card both of this devices will take. Brilliant Little Card  Good Transfer speeds highly recommend to all was exactly what i was looking for at a great price. Good price, good quality. Put it in my phone for some extra storage, and it\\'s held up very well since I got it. I bought this card for my new Samsung Galaxy Note 3, didn\\'t have to do anything but put the card in the phone, no formatting needed. Transferred all of my pictures and a few videos along with about 15 GB of music everything loaded very quickly and I still have a ton of memory left to store whatever I want or need to. Bought this on Amazon at a much better price than I could find anywhere else. I ordered this with Amazons frustration free packaging, just pull the tab on the package and the card is in your hand in less than ten seconds. Recommend for anyone who wants a fast card and a lot of memory. I bought this item based off other reviews and recommendations. Installation was extremely easy, and both cards (I bought 2) were shipped in perfect condition. Like others have noted: actual added storage is just over 29 GB. Buying via Amazon was a huge discount as opposed to local in-store options.Shipping was perfect. I would recommend this product to friends/family. They are scandisk micro SD, they work well and I have never had a problem with this product brand. short a couple words, sorry This card is fast! And cheap!  I used it on my Canon S100 Camera to shoot raw format pictures and 1080 video and it worked flawlessly.  I\\'m currently using it on my old Mytouch phone for storage.Great product, great price. this card is great you can save lots of pictures or files on this card the card works great in most phones very useful for surface pro to increase capacity from 128GB. Can also be used as backup in case something goes wrong Yee so this is the maximum space allowed in the gopros to my knowledge. The older versions like the Hero 3 are the larger SD cards but now the micro SD cards are allowed. Great price and great quality for those HD pictures and movies. Get it. Amazing how they keep making bigger storage cards and the price goes down. Wow, these are nice for holding lots of stuff I am not sure that I can say anything that has not been covered in the previous 13,660 reviews that have already been written for this memory card, but I will add my comment.Its a great card and it works great in my camera.  The storage capacity is more than I needed, but the price was too good not to get it. For this special price I could not let them go.I bought a few cards for my phone, my gopro and my camera.... Ideal It work great in my Asus Tablet for 3 months then it just completely died. It was not recognized by any of my devices. It had just died.I have RMA\\'d it to Sandisk. The prcess was painless and my replacement should arrive within a few days. They emailed me a return label thru UPS and sent it off last week.When it worked the performance was great and access times were very fast. No lag in reading and writing data.If you get this just make sure you have a back up of your data incase of failure. Had my Tablet synced to my cloud service so I did not lose anything. I have purchased other Sandisk items and have never had a issue. for my Galaxy note 10.1.  This is necessary if you use the tablet as much as I do.  Don\\'t get a smaller card. This card worked in my Galaxy S3 right off the bat.  I did not need to format it or anything.  After about 2 weeks, I was watching a video on my phone and it locked up.  Then the phone showed that the card was damaged.  Now I am unable to copy anything over 100mb to or from the card.  Viewing photos from the gallery also locks up the phone.  Amazon customer service is great, however.  They sent me a new card.  I will update my review after I am able to use the new one for at least a month without any errors.****UPDATE****After having the second card for a few weeks, it also had the same issues.  Even worse, the card was completely unreadable after it locked up.  The card showed about 5 GB of data being used, but could not be accessed via the phone or in a computer.  Sent this one back and will be going back to my trusty 16GB card. Using this on my Samsung Galaxy S4.  It works well and has good read/write speeds.  Very pleased with this card. Before putting it into my phone I formatted and moved all the data over to it from my 16GB microSD. Popped it into my phone and has been in there for the last 4 months with no problems. Picked it up for about 27 bucks, very good deal. It works just fine and I\\'m thinking of getting a 64GB for my tablet later on.  I don\\'t have too much more to say except buy! Got this to replace my old class 4 micro sd card in my new phone. Plenty of space and very fast. Use this with my GoPro Hero 3 HD to record high definition sports video and this chip does it very well. I would definitely recommend it I bought this for my new camera, and the price is incredible. I am a big fan of SanDisk when it comes to memory cards, so of course, I bought one for my camera, but was unsure about it fitting in my new camera (Samsung wb30f). Turns out, it fits, and the storage capacity is incredible. I am a picture lover, so whenever I am able to take pictures, I do. This gave me over 4,000 pictures (maybe even more, I can\\'t remember). Great price, great storage capacity... can\\'t go wrong Great card but have had some issues with my GoPro 3 with this one. Maybe a firmware update will help my situation. I picked this up as a deal of the day.  No issues at all.  Put it in my phone, and then connected the phone (Galaxy S4) to the computer and dropped music and pictures in the folder and everything was quick and easy! Works just fine for the Go-Pro I bought a few months ago. It\\'s works just great for what it\\'s made for. No issues, plug and play.I have not run benchmarks, but I do store all of my camera and video data to the card. This includes a lot of high definition Daily Roads dashboard cam footage. There\\'s no issues caching all of the temp video files, or storing the ones I opt to save due to the apparently speed and capacity of this card.The only con is the fact I waited so long to buy one. :) If you\\'re getting this card it means you\\'re 1337 like me.  Or at least you aspire...Carry on young diamond...carry on. Can\\'t beat the price on this one. 64GB and SD card reader. I use this is in my go Pro 3+ works fantastic. Arrived DOA but Amazon sent me another one right away and it is perfect. I use it with my GoPro HERO 3 and it is a must if shooting 1440 or better video in order to keep up.Do you need 64gb? Maybe, maybe not but you do need Class 10 so buy it and never look back! Not sure what the point is of reviewing a stanard 32G memory card.  Purchased for a tablet and works fine. I am continually amazed by the fact that this tiny bit of almost nothing can be so powerful.  However, I caution anyone buying these Micro Cards for their GoPro that they are extremely easy to lose, but I highly recommend them. True to its name! Sandisk is the best! I am only using this for my smartphone so I guess it\\'s overkill! Many said this type of micro SD card is meant for DSLR\\'s. I\\'m going for quality and something that would last a long time. That\\'s why I went for this. Highly recommended! I have used this product with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and my Sony Xperia Z1 and it performs without fail.  This added much need memory for my phone to take pictures and video.  I would recommend to all Android phone owners. Added lots of storage space to my new Nokia Lumia 1520. Very nice! The package got here very quickly and I was able to install it easily. The phone recognized it immediately. I did turn off the phone before inserting the SD. It came with an adapter that I didn\\'t need to convert it from Micro SD. it is amazing how much storage they can fit into such a small form factorremember 1.5 mb floppy disks ?heck this thing is soooo small you might lose itits like pinky nail size smalland holds 64 GB ! awesome NOT GOOD REPEATEDLY SELF EJECTS FROM NEW GALAXY S4  RETURNED FOR EXCHANGE OR REFUND....BOUGHT TWO ONE WORKS WELL BUT ONE DOESN\\'T I GUESS IS DEFECTIVE....I HAVE TWO GAL S4,..IS WHY I BOUGHT 2... SanDisk is a great brand and it has failed. I have purchased several of these so I think it was just bad luck. I am sure Amazon will replace it. San disk has always been a good brand for me.  It worked very well for my samsung galaxy phones and tablets. I used this to replace the existing Transcend MicroSDHC card in my phone. I find that only a few pieces of my equipment can access it - apparently some older firmware devices do not recognize 64 GB SD. One trick I found - I was able to format this in my tablet, then move it into my phone. Initially, my phone reported it as a corrupt SD. Other than that, I have had no issues with it - it is reliable and stable, but not lightning fast. It took me over two hours to copy my photos and music onto it. Big fan of SanDisk and even more so as the price of flash decreases. Can\\'t compare to other brands as never has a reason to switch, Minor price variations do not compel to do so and performance/quality has never been in issue in many years of suing brand. Seems to work just fine. I have loaded it up about 1/3 full and deleted the files and nothing unexpected has happened. I have a dashcam.  It didn\\'t come with a memory card so I got this.This card has been working well in a fairly demanding capacity.  That\\'s because like the way most drivers use dashcams, I\\'ve got mine set to 10 minute loops.  That means new data is being written over and over again on this card.  So far the card hasn\\'t quit on me and I\\'m pleased. the phone that memory resides plays video and media fast.  Sandisk always makes excellent products and for memory it is leader. I would recommend this memory card to anyone. It works well with my tablet. I have no problems with it. Works like it\\'s suppose to, quick and efficient, stable and reasonably priced. So far so good, put it in the camera and go. If you carry two of these, one in your camera and one in the camera case pocket (don\\'t lose it), you will never run out of memory. Enough capacity at ~4MB/image to shoot and shoot and shoot.  Download at the end of the day if you want, but you have thousands of pictures on one of these. Couple with batteries (see WASABI review) and you can just never stop shooting. This is very good memory for GoPro. Went with 32GB because my brother, who has two GoPro cameras, said he never filled up his 32 so why go for 64? Anyway, this is versatile enough to go in phone or camera, I ordered two more. I am giving this item a five star rating because it works well and can be used in a micro or standard format. Just what I am expecting for this brand, I installed it in my tablet the moment it arrives and it works perfectly. I was given this card in October to add to my new Samsung Galaxy S3. I was thrilled I copied a ton of music onto the card and used my phone as my mobile Ipod substitute, leaving my Ipod Classic on my desktop in its speaker system cradle.Everything worked fine until a couple of weeks ago. I started getting messages that seemed to say that I had removed and inserted the memory card. Of course, I hadn\\'t touched it. Then a few days ago the phone told me that the card contained unsupported files and that I needed to reformat it. Well, I tried reformatting. After that, nothing. Nothing at all. I pulled the memory card, reset the phone. Reinserted the card. Nothing. I tried the card in the adapter on 3 computers. It wasn\\'t even visible.I called Sandisk tech support. It didn\\'t take terribly long to convince them that I had a problem. But they quickly offered me two 16 gb cards as a replacement. I literally laughed at them. I got the disturbing sense that this is something that they are required to try. If so, that\\'s a lousy business practice. After bouncing me around a few time, they agreed to send me an RMA and a shipping label. I duly sent the card off a couple of days ago. To be frank, I have no idea at all when I might receive a replacement.If I weren\\'t already in the grips of Sandisk, I would buy another card. The fact that 10% of the comments here are negative is an indication of a real quality control problem. A 10% fail rate is simply unacceptable for a product such as this.Update: Well, I do have to give Sandisk credit for customer support. I returned the card using the supplied UPS label on a Tuesday and I received a replacement by UPS on the following Monday. That\\'s very good service. It does, however, increase my suspicion about the offer of two 16 gb because the 32 gb cards were \"out of stock.\" If they were out of stock, they sure got \"in stock\" in a big hurry. In any event, I\\'ve upped my rating to two stars. I bought this for my grandson to work with his new tablet.  He\\'s very happy with it, so much so that I\\'m sure that he prefers tablets to laptops.  It gives him all the function that he needs.  This Memory Card ensures that he can keep his data and move it to the next tablet, whenever its needed. I got this for both my phone and camera. Can\\'t decide what to use it in first, LOL depends on what I feel like carrying with me... I was afraid to buy it for so many comments saying it doesn&#8217;t work with hero3 at high resolutions video, but it was not my case. I mean it\\'s a 64gb memory card. The price was right (caught a sale) and its a big ole memory card. I like SanDisk and haven\\'t had any trouble! Love it. It works great and is fairly cheap compared to other 64gb SD cards without sacrificing quality. SanDisk has always made great products. Gave my galaxy S4 plenty of memory and at a good price. I had a problem with my first one but Amazon sent me a replacement next day which worked perfectly.  I would recommend this to anybody. Bought a digital recorder with a memory card slot.  This card worked perfectly.  No problems and my files have a newhome.  Definitely worth the price and met expectations for data storage. Not much to say, its a memory card but it works great in my Go Pro Hero 3 Silver Edition.  Using 960x60, this card gave me 8.5 hrs of video recording time.  Definitely a good buy 32 gig MicroSD card that costs less than a dollar per gig and is Class 10! And even more importantly, it tests at class 10 and operates at class 10, which is saying a lot compared to a lot of other &#34;Class 10&#34; cards. I\\'m a nerd and a hoarder. I waited a year for more memory than 64gb. I wanted to carry my extensive digital comic collection on my tablet. No longer waiting. Happy nerd. Great price! works flawless with my note 3. I love it!!! So glad I purchased this memory card. A must have to expand your memory on your phone. Called GoPro - they recommended this specific card.  They said the 64GB cards have been causing problems.  You can run your GoPro Hero3 with 2x Batteries attached to it, and you still won\\'t fill up this card (even on HD Video).I went on a 2 week surf voyage across Hawaii and 2 of these badboys documented my whole trip! Gets the job done for my GoPro so that\\'s good. I just never liked how small the actual card is due to its nature of it might just get lost...then that\\'s game over. The price was amazing, so I got two for the price of half of one. This cards holds everything I can think to out on it. I have barely filled it up. It works fast, there is no lag when accessing it. The card let\\'s you take HD video straight onto it. I was able to plug it in, use the format utility and it worked just fine (this is on the galaxy s3).  Now every ounce of my ripped CD\\'s are on my phone with 32gb  to spare.  Not much else to say. I own both 64 and 32GB cards for use in my phone as well as GoPRO cameras. They have been reliable and worked well right out of the box with no problems. No complaints at all. I own a couple of these and I\\'ve tested them on several devices.  I use these cards mainly for my mobile devices.  The 64 gb has performed well on my galaxy note 2 and galaxy note 3.  I\\'ve tested the transfer rates and they are within the prescribed range.  These are not the fastest class 10 cards, but they are sufficient for storing pictures, movies, and songs. I\\'m able to play songs and movies off of the card without any delay at all. I had purchased a cheaper cellphone, and the great price on this item made it the perfect accessory/alternative to buying a much more expensive phone.Class 10 speed means that I don\\'t have to worry about any lag in accessing my files.  I have had no issues what so ever with having to format the card.  It worked perfectly with my phone (Samsung Axiom) right out of the box. I use this with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, and it has worked seamlessly. I use it to store movies to watch while travelling, and haven\\'t had an issue yet. The transfer speed is great and Playing movies from the card has not been a problem. Installed it to my Galaxy S4. Works great!I want more.. waiting for price to go down.. and I wish 128GB comes out soon so I can buy it Purchased this along with the Nifty Minidrive for use as my Time Machine backup my Macbook Air 13&#34;. Perfect expansion! This card is pretty cheap for how tiny (physically) and large (digitally) it is - at least in mid 2014. I got it to extend the storage capacity of my Surface Pro 3, and it has done just that. I can store files on it so that I don\\'t have to take up precious space that can be dedicated towards programs since the Surface Pro 3 has a full Windows 8 on it. It also doubles as a storage device for my GoPro Hero 3 Black, but I have a faster card for it to prevent the freezing issue. The size of this micro SD card just does a great job in storing data like videos, photos, and music. It fits in most devices that are moving to Micro SDXC, such as phones, tablets, and my beloved Surface Pro 3. I highly recommend this card if you just need to extend the storage of your device. Reconsider a faster card if you want to record video straight to it, like with a GoPro. I bought this to be able to load more music into my Verizon LG Android phone. I spent hours adding music to the card. Then, I put it into my Android phone. The phone did not read anything on the memory card. The other memory cards, 8GB and 32GB worked fine, so it must be a flaw in this memory card. Also, this memory card got stuck in my Android phone\\'s slot. I had to use a utility knife with a very, very thin blade to pull out this card. There are things that I would like to say about the sand disk ultra.It is the best dang SD card I\\'ve ever used.  All rights so let\\'s be honest I just put this in my phone so that I would have extra storage for photos and videosHowever it is really good because it just sits in my phone and I don\\'t have to do anything about it.Seriously I can access everything by Just connecting my phone to USB so it is essentially like the phone has another hard drive. I love this memory card!! I upgraded the memory on my phone from a 2gb stock card to this and, not only are the transfer rates from card to phone and back WAY faster, but the capacity is great!! I\\'ve now replaced my iPod with this because I can have all of my music on my phone as well as any games and I don\\'t have to use iTunes to interface, just drag and drop. Oh, and it\\'s waterproof. Like my phone. Just saying. This brand has proven to be reliable and easy to work with. It is versatile for use in my Android devices as well as cameras. Nothing is permanent and I try to have a back up of my files, but it has served me well for a couple of years. Ordered this one because my 2GB finally wasn\\'t enough storage and I thought I could use the extra GB for future use. SD card is legit and does very well! Definitely recommended. Good quality product for the price, I bought it for my go pro and I haven\\'t had any issues yet. I couldn\\'t find this cheaper anywhere else, for the price you simply can\\'t get anything better. Write VERY fast, and has plenty of storage. Using this in my BlackBerry Q-10.Very recommended! The 32 gig San Disk memory card went into a tablet given as a Christmas gift.No problems and fast performance.I loaded all the music and some video that was stored in a laptop.I still have 12 gigs left.Very happy with the memory unit. Tried this with its adapter on DSLR Camera and got some errors at times while trying to save data to card.  It is ok for other uses like computer external data. I bought this for my Android device and it works great!It even comes with a converter so if I\\'d like to use it for images or movies I could!I\\'d highly recommend this product to anyone needing memory for their Phone, Android Player, Camera or anything that uses SD and /or Micro SD! Moved my music library for phone/car use.Easy to set up and reliable.The drivers didn\\'t like my older laptop so I had to work around it - any teen can tell you how to do so with only a slight roll of the eyes. I\\'m not a techie, so I can\\'t do all those great experiments to determine whether or not the transfer speed is as advertised. All I know is, the card works just fine in my Galaxy S3. So far, it has worked great, and seems to be pretty speedy.I have San Disk cards in quite a few of my tech toys, and they\\'ve always performed well. I am confident that this one will do the same. heard wonky reports on using a 64gig card in the S3, i have no experience or background in knowing that personally, so i did the safe thing and went with the 32 gig. I would like to get up to 64 but 5 star rating for this product. Got this to plug into a 1/2 adapter for the Raspberry Pi. I had to play with the Pi case a bit, but it all fits nicely without the full size sd card sticking out. I bought this memory for my Samsung Tab 2 8.0. So far it works quite well. I wish my Samsung would recognize the 64 GB. There\\'s a lot of counterfeits on these, and I apparently picked up a bum card from MemoryWhiz. My device shows me there\\'s a 32gb of space there; it just is impossible to gain access to it. Rather, the /sdcard folder is found on my device\\'s internal memory (the memory that came with the device). I even downloaded some apps that were supposed to read and write from my SDCard, but they work even when I unmount the card and remove it. So check out these cards thoroughly when you buy them and make sure they\\'re what they say they are. Naturally, SanDisk isn\\'t going to stand by a counterfeit. SOOOO pleased with this little dude.  I actually bought 2 of these - a 32GB and a 16GB for 2 MEEPS that are Christmas gifts, which, BTW, is about the coolest little tablet for little kids as it does it all - books, movies, games, internet, etc - all parentally controlled via cloud!!!  The MEEP has adaquate memory to a degree like all other handheld devices, however, if you want to store a lot games/movies/books on the MEEP you need an extra memory card and this is THE card to buy.  This 32GB was bought to go into a MEEP for the 4 year old and I don\\'t know if she needed a Class 10, but for the low price of this SanDisk, why not?  I highly recommend this little card and the MEEP it went in - both are absolutely worth every penny. Bought it for my Galaxy S5. Dumped 32g of music on it and so far so good. It\\'s nice to have plenty of storage. Works great in the Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. I purchased one for my phone and one for my son\\'s phone and they both work great! We\\'ve had no problems with either card. My son loves that he was able to put his whole music library, several translator apps and bible versions, along with several movies on his phone to take with him on a mission trip to Peru and still had room to store thousands of photos he took while there. Being able to use a card like this is one of the main reasons I switched from an iPhone to an S3. Love it! This does exactly what you would expect from a 32GB MicroSD memory card. Plenty of storage and fast access times make this a solid purchase. Formatted card with SDFormatter 3.1PC used to test this card Sony vaio C2D sz645 + vaio memory card adapter VGP-MCA20A.h2testw 1.4 test results:Test finished without errors.Writing speed: 6.94 MByte/sReading speed: 12.5 MByte/sH2testw v1.4Android phone Samsung Exhibit 2SDTools test result:9.3MB/s write21.3MB/s readAlso tested write speed with an older model Sandisk usb 2.0 sd card reader and cheap generic unbranded reader, get about same results. I don\\'t have any devices that can handle UHS-1 \"ultra\" speed of this card. Seems like a class 6 card or none of my gadgets can handle 10MB/s write speed or it\\'s a class 6 card sold as class 10. Got this to use with the GoPro Hero 3 motion camera - fits and works just fine.  Big enough to film several flights and not run out of space. I purchased this to expand the storage space of my Samsung Galaxy S3 and I love it!  It\\'s fast and offers lots of storage space.  I use it to store several full length HD movies on my phone which I view when travelling.  In addition I have tons of music on it too. I was working with a three of these cards using the included adapter, and thought they were slower than they should be.  I just bought a full size Sandisk Ultra 16GB class 10 (all the same specs except size theoretically) for a different project, and it writes over twice as fast on the same computer! The write speed on this card is between 7 and 10 MB/s, the read seems to be 35MB/s, compared to the full size card with write speed of 22 to 25MB/s and a read speed of 42MB/s (this is from an imaging program, not a benchmark program, so it\\'s not checking different sizes of transfer and the like).  Compare that with a Transcend 4 GB Class 4 card, the write speed is nearly identical (7 to 9MB/s), while the read speed on the class four is 12 to 13MB/s, significantly slower, as expected.The read speed is good, but the write speed is abysmal!  If it says \"Class 10\", it should be somewhat close to the Class 10 spec.I\\'m returning them. Works great, another awesome Amazon purchase! I use it in my Samsung Galaxy S 3. I\\'ve never had an issue with sandisk memory cards, and likewise.  Great price for what you\\'re getting, memory is getting cheaper, and speed isn\\'t a huge issue for me for smartphone use, so this was ideal.  Can never go wrong with sandisk. This card has worked flawlessly so far. I use it in my Garmin Montana 600 and it allows me to load all my USGS 1:24,000 quads (US - SW, W, S Central, N Central and inland lakes) I was at first concerned that the 600 would not take 32 gb micro SD but no problem. It was good until I lost it in the house.  I think they should put a big ass light on it so I won\\'t loose it. This is a fast card that I trust more than the off-brands not to die. Sandisk has also lowered their prices to be more in line with the competition. All in all, this is a great card at a good price. I\\'ve now bought 5 of these cards I like them so well.  I take a lot of pictures in RAW, often times filling one of the 64GB cards up in a day or less.  They are fast and very handy due to the small size. This was a good deal for my wife\\'s new Samsung galaxy III,..fit right in(I did remove the battery first,..and so far have had no issues with the chip.....does what it\\'s supposed to. I use this memory card in a Lenovo ThinkPad Twist. It uses a PCIe Realtek memory card reader, which I fine tuned by bypassing Lenovo\\'s drivers and use the latest reference ones from Realtek directly.In short, I care about bottlenecks that things like a USB card reader adds.I run apps and thousands of files from this card, streaming atop Bitlocker To Go in Windows 8. Already I\\'ve poured multiples of the 32 GB capacity in reads and writes to this fingernail-sized drive, and it has kept going.An unbelievable deal, as I\\'m normally pretty cheap on these things... but I\\'m glad I was able to get the best for cheap... for once. This card has performed flawlessly so far. No read or write errors, or speed problems. Not much more to say, but I had to fill up the Amazon word count. This has really just been used to store some extra files and pass between computers. It came with the converter to change it to a standard SD card. No issues with either. It always amazes me how so much data can be stored in such a small space. Anyway, it will get more use in the next month. I\\'m planning on upgrading phones and will knock it down a star if it seems to slow to record video to. So if you just see 5 stars, it means I am lazy and the disk is still good. This item arrive on time.  Upon receiving it I put it in an electronic device and it stores stuff you need to store.  Nice colors too. I purchased this to put into my Samsung Galaxy Blaze, mainly to store music.  I previously owned an Adata 32GB card which died after a couple weeks.The most annoying thing about large storage is copying files to it, especially when the card is slow.  A class 4 would take well over 2 hours to fill up, while this one takes just a bit over 45 minutes.Using the Antutu benchmark suite, this card clocked in at 11.1MB/s write and 21.7MB/s read.I didn\\'t have to format it or anything, just popped it out of the packaging and threw it right into the sd slot of my phone. The microsd is faster that most and is very reliable. I can now hold all my music on my phone. The warranty is also decent on this card. I would recommend it to anyone especially at this great price. Pros:Maximum external storage for my SGS3.Plenty of space on my phone now to store music and pictures.Fast data transfer.Cons:none.Other:Shipped super fast (think i actually got it next day) packaged well. I\\'ve never had a problem with SanDisk products.  Just make sure your camera or device can actually use 32GB -- some are limited to 16GB. I was using a basic memory card in my Samsung Note 3 and when I took a picture it took forever for the phone to put it in the memory card and get ready for a new picture. Once I installed this Sandisk the transfer was almost non-existent. What a difference. Worth the few extra bucks. Git this for my daughters samsung Galaxy S3. It has been working great in her phone, fast with no problems I haven\\'t done much to speed test this device, but it does everything I ask it to and the price was right. I would not recommend this card if your looking for REAL class 10 write speeds. The most I could get is 9mb/s from this card but for the most part it was about 7-8mb/s. I even did a slow format to exfat in windows 7 with no improvements. I copied over music, pics and movies to test it out ranging from a couple of mb to over a gb. The read speeds were pretty good at around 21mb/s though. I popped in a 32gb class 10 transcend SD card and it consistently got 16-18mb/s write speeds and 24mb/s read speeds. So in conclusion I think this card is not really a class 10. Too bad I read all the negative 1 star reviews after the fact but I will be sending this one back. Of late, Sandisk appears to have lost their way a little with their flash storage products. It\\'s almost a universal truth that all of their USB flash drives are hopelessly slow; while they\\'re usually reliable, transfer rates of 4MB/sec or less are worthless when filling a 32GB drive. Fortunately, their \"Ultra\" line of SD cards still appears to buck this trend.Formatted as NTFS and used in anelago Mobile Nano II reader, I see write speeds on a 64-bit Linux machine at a consistent 15-16MB/sec when copying large (1GB or larger) files to this card, which more than lives up to its class 10 billing. Reads appear to run at about 19-20MB/sec.I can\\'t comment on reliability as I\\'ve only had the card a few days, but everything I\\'ve copied so far for testing has made it onto the card (and off again) with no corruption whatsoever; the MD5 checksum of every file I\\'ve transferred matches the source. That\\'s more than can be said for the Supertalent Pico USB drive that this SD card and reader are intended to replace, which has never been quite right (it\\'s always occasionally randomly corrupted files of larger than 100MB or so, and the probability of 1GB or greater files surviving was near zero).32GB appears to be the sweet spot at the moment; smaller cards don\\'t cost that much less, and larger cards are beyond the SDHC spec and into SDXC territory, which isn\\'t yet universal in terms of device compatibility (not to mention they cost far more than double for 64GB).For what I paid for this around Thanksgiving (not part of any explicit sale, but definitely a lower price than appears usual as far as camelcamelcamel is concerned) I\\'m extremely satisfied.Edit: I should also mention that the included mechanical full-size SD adaptor is one of the worst I\\'ve ever encountered. There\\'s a lot of friction when the microSD card is inserted, and it\\'s a right bugger to get it out of the adaptor again. Thankfully I have a few other such adaptors lying around should I ever need one; this one\\'s going in the bin. Works great in Canon 7d ( (microSD) to (SD adapter) to (SD to Compact flash adapter) for fast shooting and video.  Also works great with GO Pro models.  This card keeps up with the data rates required by the digital media devices todayRecommend this for Canon 7D* (*adapters needed) and GoPro. It\\'s A good reliable product that I can always rely upon. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a micro sd. Works as it should. i use it with my GoPro HERO 3+ and I have not had any issues. Holds tons of footage. I have 4 of these and it is overkill but they were so cheap that why not. Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. Bought a Windows Surface with 8 Pro. It has a 128GB SSD which is pretty good, but adding the card gives me 64GB of storage and backup that is nearly as fast as the SSD. This thing is quick, no waiting for things to load. The free app has a good UI and is actually helpful unlike a lot of free apps. I bought two of these for my samsung Galaxy note 10.1.  Just to be on the safe side...I put them in my note FIRST and formatted them, then took them out and put media on them.  I use the media card reader with these and it works just fine on my computer and tablet. Works. There\\'s nothing else to say so yes it works, and yes it works. It also works, so it is pretty good. I use this in my Android Phone, pretty much for MP3\\'s to play in my truck. It certainly doesn\\'t perform like a Class 10 card when writing the files to it but not for me, wasn\\'t that important. Works according to the camera requirements. Reads fast, writs fast, it\\'s a good card! I though about buying the 32 gb card, but I found that you can actually move the pics from the camera to your iphone/ipad, so you actually don\\'t need more capacity. This SDHC is fast. Great for cameras, the pictures take nothing to record and the next shot is quick and easy. I use it with Raspberry Pi, that needs fast media. Works perfectly. This was a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it, he said it works perfectly. So i am happy with the result I used this card to replace the hard disk in my old laptop so I can use it to stream netflix. I installed linux Ubuntu on it. The card works great. It\\'s very fast and is very reliable. I recommend it. I use this to store music/video/pictures in my phone. Works well for that purpose. No hiccups or speed issues. Bueno. Transfers fast, look slick (as if anyone cares about that), it uh.. transfers fast.  And it works?  Actual capacity is like 31.9 gb.  Sorry if you desperately needed that last .1gb. I love the ultras cause it writes fast to the card with my samsung S3 with not much time in between pics.  I also got one for my Fuji waterproof camera and it takes a few seconds before I can take another photo but that is the limitation of the processor of the camera, not the card. Overall, I love it.  My computer can read them fast and videos are played back at real speed I mounted it in my tablet (Lenovo Thinkpad 2) and it has been doing just fine and working well without any problems. What more can I say? The 64GB micro SD works for the Samsung Galaxy Note II! I simply popped in the card and there it was with no formatting. \"59GB of space\" couldn\\'t be more happier. I used it with my Samsung S4 and it works great. I bring a lot of music and movies with me when I travel and it is great that I don\\'t have to bring an entire hard drive or extra memory cards that can be misplaced. Totally worth the money. Does it\\'s expected job. I use it in a dash cam video in my car and the quality is perfect. Could not be happier.  It\\'s fast, works great, and I didn\\'t have to risk an appendage trying to get it out of retail packaging.  I\\'ve been a fan of SanDisk for years, and this is why - solid product. Great deal for a great product. Recommended for anyone needing to expand the memory of their portable devices. Comes with SD adapter for use in card readers. This works with my Galaxy S4 and is fast enough to record 1080P video. I would purchase again I have always had good luck with SanDisk cards. Worked great in my galaxy s4 and died about 2 months later, what a waste of a lot of money! Good to have an extra one for the camera or tablet. Holds a lot of data. I use it to extend Nook\\'s memory. Not much to say. It works well enough so I can forget it exists. Got this to expand the memory of my son\\'s Go Pro camera.  It does the job for much less than the box stores had it for. Excellent price for the amount of storage and speed. I just washed this in the washing machine and was preparing to buy another. After checking it for errors it came up with none. Needless to say I don\\'t have to buy another but did feel compelled to write a review. Cheers! Price was great on Amazon and now even better.  Have the chip in my phone and it appears to work great.....fast and so far no errors have been encountered. SanDisk makes great products and this one\\'s just another of them.  I\\'m using it in a vehicle dash camera to record HD .mov format video and on my shakedown run the camera and the disc worked perfectly together!  32gb of space gives me plenty of room to record, and the Class 10 rating means the card is plenty fast enough to keep up and produce crisp and clear video.  Color was also good. I\\'m not going to give you a detailed speed and what not but this SD card is fast compared to the other ones. You wouldn\\'t really notice the difference in speed unless you\\'re copying a huge file. I use this on my Note 2 and I take a butt load of pictures with my phone. I used it and it worked fine. i try to buy many of sandisk products more often but its a bit pricey Excellent cards. I have this one in my ASUS Transformer  and a 16 GB one in my camera. Both work flaulessly. I bought a similar one to this a little while back for a digital camera, I think I should\\'ve gotten this one instead. I believe it\\'s faster (I think mine was Class 4 for the same price). For the money I feel I have all the memory I\\'ll ever need for my smart phone, same for my HD video camera. I just love this because i just got a new smart phone and now i am ready to do some down loading. delivery was on time, Works perfect with my Galaxy Note 2. great customer service. Thanks for the product.Able to store all my music and movies on my phone now. Alot of storage for a great price. Only one probkem: since I installed this card into my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, about once a month or so, when I turn the phone on in the morning it gets stuck in some sort of &#34;boot loop&#34; and hangs on the AT&T logo screen. My phone is stock, and I have altered the software in no way. Granted, I cannot be sure that the card is the cause of this problem, but if I remove it and then boot the phone, it works properly. I love SanDisk products, and I will definitely continue to buy them. Just a word of warning. No problems at all using this in my Samsung Galaxy S III. Fit right in and started working. I would suggest this to anyone I got it and tested it block by block.  No issues.  I tested the speed in various applications and on my laptop in a good USB3.0 reader got no less than 4meg/sec and often a little over 10meg/sec.  Speed will (of course) vary depending on all the hardware and what you are transferring. If, like me, you are still happily in the Stone Age with Windows XP, your computer will not be able to use this card unless you install Windows Update KB955704.  This update is available from Microsoft.com.Thanks to dOGG94, who pointed this out in Customer Questions and Answers on August 6, 2013.  I installed this update and am now able to load GoPro\\'s pictures onto my computer. dOGG94\\'s answer to the customer question provides the link to the update.  Amazon did not allow me to post the link here.  I don\\'t know why.  Just go to the Microsoft.com updates site and look for KB955704.  Or go to the indicated question for the link.The product description should have provided this information. I have had cheaper SD Cards in the past, but they almost always wound up letting me down. I made up my mind some time ago that I would stick with SanDisk and have been completely satisfied with all my cards from them ever since. This card sits in my wife\\'s phone and is used to store all her music and pictures. It has been in & out close to a dozen times (because I like to fiddle with stuff) and as proven very durable.In case anyone wants to know, &#34;Class 10&#34; is the only way to go with these cards (until they come out with something faster), the read/write speed is well worth the few extra bucks for my needs.I also have a &#34;Class 10&#34; 64 GB in my Galaxy SIII and it\\'s as good or better. I even got it wet (I mean soaked) and it is still working like a charm.I will definitely recommend this to anyone, and will be sticking with SanDisk for all my other devices. It\\'s hard to argue the quality of SanDisk products, and this one is no exception, providing both a high capacity micro SD card and an adapter to allow it to be used in the larger SD form factor, particularly nice for those of us who have a need for both. My wife and I just upgraded our phone to Note 3 and wanted more space.  We had the phone for 4 days now and Micro SD card works fine.  However, I feel transfer rate is slow when transfering movies from my desktop to SD card.  1.2GB movie will take about 12-16 minutes.  I have pretty high end gaming PC.  Intel I7 980X CPU, 12GB Memory, 7870 ATI Graphic card, 120GB SSD card, 3TB hard drive for storage, 1200W 80Plus Gold PUS, ASUS Sabortooth motherboard,etc.  When transfering movies or file to my WD 2.5 inch external hard drive will take 1-2 minutes.  Still satisfied, since I have more than 90GB of storage on my phone. Purchased this to drop into my Galaxy Note II. Exactly what I wanted.Loaded up the entirety of the card in about 18 minutes, which is not super fast, but very good considering the card was in the phone instead of in the computer using the include adapter.I purchased this product with the worry-free packaging and was for the first time not frustrated with SanDisk.The Super Saver Shipping really sold the deal to me.The price now is on par with most retailers, but I got two Duds from BestBuy and was good to go with the first one from Amazon, doesn\\'t really say much about the product, but gives you a bit of peace of mind when purchasing from this vendor. I got this not for the space but the speed.  Class 4 is ok, but class 10 is where its at.  Copying files, scanning the card, cleaning caches, writing files, this thing grinds threw it all like nothing.  Before it would take 2 minutes upon boot of my phone for my old class 4 32GB micro sd card would be done scanning.  With this its 7 seconds. From what I\\'ve read, some Galaxy users have had problems with MicroSD cards, but this one works great so far; lots of apps are willing to store their data on it, and Samsung\\'s built-in camera is able to put its photos there instead of in the system memory, so it helps free up a lot of space for apps and things that have to be in the system memory. I\\'ve put all my MP3s on the card as well and they play back perfectly using both the Samsung music app and Google Music. Never had a failure with SanDisk like other mfgrs.  I use this in my smartphone, comes with an SDHC adapter.  When smartphone makers stop including a micro-sd slot, I\\'ll simply use this in my camera or laptop. Before doing research, i assumed this card would support my brand new Hero 3 camera... considering it was sold off the Gopro site, it was a no brainer... or so i thought.Anyhow, the card seems to preform well under most circumstances WITHOUT using the Protunes settings. (The problems with the Hero 3 where due to the slow write speed of this card under Protunes settings, without this setting the Hero works fine)However, after a few timelapse issues (2 - 5 sec timelapse, which is well in this card\\'s speeds).I noticed the card is corrupt. I tested this in other cameras and found that this problem still persists. I trust Sandisk as my top choice for all my professional work, however this card has failed!I would not recommend this EXPENSIVE card, id jump for a Samsung, or even the Transcend cards. They even come with a better warranty then this card.Nothing but problems and lost memories that i cant replace.... It is reliable sd card. I always used this brand for all of my camera, my smartphone and tablet.Fyi Item arrived in time as promised. Works well with a galaxy note 10.1. There is nothing more to say about this product as it has been reviewed so many times. It works well, not a bad price at the time of ordering ( now it has come down ). Yes, you get the same card for lesser price from other sellers but I trust amazon for their customer service issues. I prefer to pay 2 bucks more and get it from amazon rather than getting it from unfamiliar sellers. I had no problems transferring stuff over to it including 30 GB of songs.  It was much faster than offbrand.  I got this in 12/2012.update: 8/2013:  I got my wife a new samsung galaxy S4.  Her old phone would only do 720p video and didn\\'t have a nice camera.  My wife is really into her photo\\'s, so I was concerned it wouldn\\'t keep up with the fancier camera.  After loading my now 33 GB of songs I got even more concerned in wouldn\\'t keep up with the fancy new camera.  I bought one of the sandisk 64 GB extreme cards and was amazed at speed difference copying songs.  Due to prior problems with generic cards, I\\'ll only buy sandisk in future.Nothing was wrong with the ultra card, it just didn\\'t seem up to par to fully take advantage of the latest/greatest phone technology.  She\\'s going to carry the old card in purse in case she fills first one. Works well. No problems after using it for a number of months. I\\'ve always found the SanDisk memory cards to be reliable. I don\\'t know, but it\\'s a bunch. This card works great in my Nook HD, no problems installing or using it. Use it in my Ainol Spark, and it gets great read/write speeds.  Dont ever use your available past 90% or you will corrupt your SD cards in a very short time.  So available is 29 gig, and dont go over say.. 26 and you will likely never get a problem with it. We often to forget the complexity of technology that we use every day.  That is surely the case with purchased memory.  One manufacturer that has never let me down is SanDisk.  I\\'ve used it often (not exclusively) and found it to be reliable quite speedy. Purchased this product for a new 7&#34; Garmin GPS. The refresh rate is so much faster than on my wife\\'s similar but smaller 5&#34; Garmin with class 4 memory. I bought two of these 128 gb MicroSD cards which I formatted to Fat32, and I currently have about 62 gb in 35,000 files on each card.  I carry one card in my wallet and keep one in a safe deposit off-site.  I\\'ve been through the SanDisk literature looking to see if there are any restrictions on their use, other than as ordinary &#34;flash memory&#34; for file storage.  There are no restrictions I could find.  What I have found is that these 128 gb cards (and a SanDisk 64 gb card I bought previously) cannot accept 62 gb of data written from a computer without suffering errors.  I\\'ve had to resort to copying no more than 1/3 gb of data at a time to these cards, stopping, then starting another 1/3 gb until the complete data is copied.  The errors actually occur early on, at approximately the 2 to 3 gb point.  I have several other 128 gb flash memory sticks - the Lexar Echo series, as well as a hundred other lower-capacity flash memory cards, and do not have this overflow/error problem with any of those.  To repeat, there are no restrictions on the use of these memory cards (example: can be used only in a camera) given by SanDisk, and given that the 62 gb of data on each card has been verified as to integrity, they are not defective. Simply excellent.  This is the second 32 GB Ultra I have purchased for my Samsung Galaxy II.  Both are working perfectly.  Data access rate is exceptional for movies.  System both stores and overrides data very easily. Have not had any issues, works as intended. I would recommend this and the price was just right. So, if you buy a tablet (that supports 32gb) just get one, or two. Before using I strongly suggest to format the card, it only takes seconds. With the SanDisk I am able to transfer my images from the phone to the other phone or the tablet with no issues.My old MicroSD was from PNY when I purchased the phone they were giving the MicroSD card for free; however, it was only 2GB card. I figured that it was time to upgrade since I only had about 20MB left of space on the card, and the phone space was full due to pictures. I spend several hours doing research for a good MicroSD card.  After reading couple articles online I found that all of my devices work great with MicroSDHC.There are a lot of choices to pick from on Amazon. However, I was debating between SanDisk, Transcend, and Samsung. I started to read Samsung MicroSD card reviews, and the first reviews were from 2012 which were 1 star, at least most of them due to the card not being a class 10.  Then I looked at the Transcend card and the reviews were good., but I was not so sure about the performance test.So the third one I looked at was SanDisk, and it appears to be the best choice for my devices just because it had so many reviews. I read a lot of reviews about this SD card and I was convinced to buy it.I have downloaded SanDisk Memory Zone for all of my devices. The app provides more management functionality for complete control. It allows to manage local and cloud memory, meaning you can move files from your phone to Box, Dropbox, Google Docs, Picasa, SugarSync, SkyDrive or from the cloud storage to the phone. The application allows to secure files with a password. I use this card in Smasung Galaxy S4 active and before that I used it in my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. It has always worked flawlessly and never given me a single problem. I use the card to copy movies to it. Playback is always smooth. I mostly play high definition movie rips. These require a lot of processing power and data transfer from the card. It has always done great. I will continue to buy this card. I have one in my MacBook Air for backups. Again, no problems.- Damon Out of the three different brands of micro sd cards the Sandisk is the only one that is still with me.  the other two just quit working.  I have bought several more of these cards and have had no problem except I wished I would have bought ones with more memory.  excellent product. I got this to add more memory to my HTC EVO LTE phone. It works perfectly, is very fast on both reads and writes, and at 32GB, provides a lot of additional storage on top of the 8GB in the phone. I recommend this specific card for any Android phone. Sorry Apple users... No expansion slot for you! :) Perfect for my SS Galaxy Note and a great price too!  I recommend this SD card for all your storage needs. I purchased this for additional memory for a smartphone and so far, so good; I have not had a problem with this memory card. I several of these 64GB cards in my GoPro 3 Black and my Canon T3i. Works great in both without any issues. Transfer speeds are lightning quick as well. Good 32 GB SD Card.  I bought it to upgrade memory stotage on my cell.  It works on my Samsung S3.  Also comes with adapter. I use this with a 1080p video camera and it performs very well.  It doesn\\'t have any issue keeping up and the transfer rates when interfacing with a computer are high. Nothing much to say here. Works great and I haven\\'t lost a single picture or video saved on here so far. Read/Write speeds are excellent.  I\\'ve been using this for a few months on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and I have no complaints. So far its working fine, I\\'ve read some negative reviews on it giving up on one, but nothing yet so good buy. The GoPro seems a bit finicky about card speeds since the last firmware upgrade I applied. The cards I\\'ve been using for quite a long time started causing it to randomly report errors and stop recording. I got a couple of these SanDisk cards and I\\'ve got the Hero powered via the USB port so I can fill the cards repeatedly without running out of battery. No errors reported so far, and I\\'ve completely filled one card twice and the other three times.I haven\\'t always had the best luck with SanDisk but these are working well so far. Fingers crossed that they last a while, I use the camera to record off-road and &#34;brisk&#34; dual-sport rides. working good. WORKS great, better than I thought - IF you cave a SURFACE TABLET  I truly recommend it it will work straight away. I couldn\\'t ask for anything better. I use it in my GoPro Hero 3. Records a lot of video and holds a lot of pics. I can\\'t measure speed and don\\'t know how you judge these things, but I do, based on experience, trust SanDisk and rely on them for giving me a hard drive, which is what this is, that will last a long while and be reliable. It\\'s good, I liked it, works perfectly with my Minidrive, but it\\'s kind of slow, sometimes it doesn\\'t reach the promised 10MB/s. Got this product and it was fine until it just stopped working...The last one I had that came with my DROID X on release day worked for the whole time since I got it without a hitch...I get this one and it\\'s dead in less than 60 days...I don\\'t know if I got a lemon myself or the whole supply is bad or faulty... All I have to say is I am very displeased! The speed is great i use it in my Galaxy Tab 3 and had a bunch of HD movies on it and i can watch movies on my tablet flawlessly, does what it says A very good product and very useful for my smart phone, adapter works fine.Recomended for all th smart phones that can expand to 64 GB I bought this for my Galaxy S4 to expand its storage capacity and it has worked great.  Fast transfer speeds as well. This card is great. It\\'s really fast compared to common cards even from Sandisk, Kingston, etc.If you need to copy files to your card in the shortest time, then this is the right one.It&#8217;s reliable, never missed a photo or music file.5 stars well deserved. I got this for my handheld GPS. It stores data not already stored in the main memory. This microsd card was as described by others and sandisk themselves. Very fast transfers and awesome price for it. Got it for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and love it! Best amount of space for the price and a quality product that works without defectives. Using this with my Galaxy 3, 4 & currently Note III. With all the great reviews on this card, I picked this up for my Samsung Galaxy S III. Popped in the card, and I was happy taking pictures, saving files, and living life.Fast forward two months later, and all of a sudden, the card stops functioning. My phone won\\'t read it any more. My computer won\\'t read it either. Submitted a ticket to Sandisk. Hopefully I can get a replacement that actually works.Thank goodness I saved all my photos on Dropbox. Just what I needed to load Video files on my Moto Xoom. Good capacity, inexpensive pricing, worked like a charm. I love this product! I would recommend this product to anyone, I gave it 5 out of 5 stars because it does everything I need it to plus more! As soon as I saw that this card was announced on the various tech sites out there, I knew that I had to buy one.  I went to Amazon and picked one up for $120.  This is a steep price compared to 64gb cards, but this is the largest capacity commercially available.  And I don\\'t want to be swapping out micro SD cards.  That is just so inconvenient.  I did various speed tests on this card and can confirm that you can get 30MB/s+ read speed.  Fastest I saw was a little over 40MB/s.  Write speed varied greatly and seemed to decrease the larger the file got.  Minimum write speed i saw was just under 10 MB/s.  I use this on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and have not have any issues with it. I have 2.Phone for over a year and no problems.Use with adapter in camera and laptop for 4-5 months without any trouble.Will continue to use SanDisk Use this card for my slr. Works fantastic and allows me to use burst mode to its full capacity (10fps)... I tried it in my Samsung mp3 player and it works but randomly shows no data and needs a reboot to fix. In all fairness it could be the device or software so I can\\'t deduct a star for that. I bought two of these for my laptop and my camera and they\\'re working great so far, good speed. 100% happy with this purchase. Works perfectly in my Verizon Wireless Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  Just popped it in, and a way it went.  No need to format and now i have plenty of room for my video\\'s, photo\\'s, and movies. But then again, I expect nothing less. Most of my compact flash and SD cards are SanDisk brand and have been extremely reliable. Es una reconocida marca y la calidad de sus productos tambi&eacute;n lo son. La velocidad para c&aacute;mares de alta definici&oacute;n es muy recomendada.It is a recognized brand and quality of their products are too. The speed for high definition Camar&eacute;s is highly recommended. I use this card in my tablet, no problems, very fast. Excellent product and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDIt was just what I needed for my tablet. Just the right amount of memory and the right price One of the best memory card out there! Will look forward to purchasing items again! Will get the 64 next... Bought this card for my Galaxy S4 and after installing it and loading my music, the card was randomly ejecting itself. After like the 3rd ejection of the morning, the phone reported that the card needed to be reformatted because it was damaged, so I reformatted. The random SDCard ejection and Damaged card kept coming up. After googling, I read that the Galaxy series phones are known to have compatibility issues with SanDisk cards and its a hit or miss, some phones have no issues. I have replaced this card already, which Amazon, shipped me a 2nd card within a few days, but the same problems arise. Not sure if I should switch to a different brand, but this card is definitely useless to me for the time being. Maybe I can give it away to a friend who doesn\\'t have an S4. :/ Good sd card does its good job I purchased mine the 64gb for my note 2 highly recommend it try it I got it when it was on sale (66% off list price!) and already it has paid for itself.  I\\'m glad to be able to have more memory for my tablet and am very happy that it comes with and SD card adaptor so that I can transfer pictures straight from my camera to my table. I like this because it works in my transformer tablet and supplies me with plenty of space to play, watch, or listen to what I want. When the wife\\'s Macbook Air SSD got full, I dropped in one of these with a near-flush mount SD adaptor (also via Amazon) and set it up as a second drive for her iTunes collection. Now she\\'s got plenty of room for pics of the kid. If you are going to add more storage to you android tablet, this is the one for you. I recommend this SSD Card. Great for pictures and music.  Came in a very secure package and a lot of storage for my files.  Reasonably priced also. Love having the extra storage this card gives me. The transfer speed to the card is slower than I would like but it plays back HD video without a hiccup. got it at a great price and it worked great, was a little upset with the tiny size of the packaging as i almost didnt even see it on my step, it arrived in a 1/4&#34; thick cardboard envelope that was about 3&#34; by 2&#34;. It came in a reasonable amount of time and was exactly as I ordered. No pretty lights and no stunning sound. Just a reliable memory card that worked and has not failed. has 32gb of storage, does what it is suppose to do and works perfectly fine in my verizon galaxy S4 Out of its storage and into my new phone.  Recognized, formatted and  and available in less than a minute.  Simple! It arrived in a timely manner and does what it is supposed to do. It\\'s not pretty and cute but it serves its purpose. 32 GB SD Card works well, and the price was reasonable, very happy with purchase so far! Worth a try! I was in need this item and couldn\\'t find it at local store.  Impressed me after i received it, it worked like a champ and able to store so many things in this card. wasn\\'t sure 64 gigs would work on my Galaxy S2It does work - and i am very pleased!Does the job! awesome product. it was worth if of buying. it\\'s cheap and have a lot of memory, not to mention the fast processing. This sd card is everything that is stated.Blazing fast and huge storage.It had so much space, when I first staryed taking pictures and videos, the phone didn\\'t even show what the limit was. It basically had no limit on how many pictures or video space was the max. Product: SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-ARating: 5/5 (Excellent)People buy MicroSD cards with 4 primary criteria in mind: (1) Storage Capacity, (2) Price, (3) Reliability/Compatibility/Availability, and (4) Speed.  When I bought the u64 back in Feb 2013 (not long after its release) it was the largest and fastest MicroSD available at the time, and it weighed in at a good price and backed up by SanDisk reputation.For me, and my Galaxy S3 {SCH-i535, currently with Android 4.3} this card has been a delightful slam dunk on all four counts.  I was reminded of this today when I slammed 30+gb of MP3\\'s from my PC onto my S3\\'s card.  The card handled the massive data dump with grace and aplomb, and I\\'m now able to use my phone to wirelessly stream my entire music library to my new bluetooth-compatible bookshelf stereo.Color me very satisfied. What can I say about it works as promised and just what I needed for my new cell phone  what more do you need love it.  Had no problems.  I have no snags or hiccups when trying to access any data or writing data on my phone. have had no problems with it, access times are actually a bit slower then in phone memory. but read is pretty good. I\\'ve had the item 12 months. I\\'ve always had minor problems. It just recently started freezing and rebooting my devices. 2 GS3\\'s, currently S4. SanDisk is sending me a new one. This card is exactly what it seems to be. It\\'s large, it\\'s fast, and it\\'s priced well. Not much more you could ask for. I put this in my hp envy x2 to extend storage, stays inside unit all the time. Works as a hard drive. It works as advertised i still own it but card went bad after 2 weeks of owning it, lost tons of music and data ect and lost all faith in sandisk products. i tried to get it replaced or money back but no return email from seller, so unhappy i lost over 20gigs of movies/music and data. wish there would have been a reply from seller or amazon but i still have a dead sdcard with all my files stuck on it. I purchased two of these microSDXC cards when they were on sale around Black Friday, and have been using them now for just about two months. They work wonderfully and I have had absolutely no problems with either. These SanDisk memory cards are 64 GB microSDXC class 10, UHS-1 cards, which are rated for transfer speeds up to 30MB/sec.The UHS class 1 designation is intended as an performance measure that indicates the card is capable of supporting real-time full HD video recording. Of course, this only works if you are using a device which is capable of writing to the card at those speeds, but most modern devices that offer full HD recording, such as camcorders, digital SLR cameras, and cell phones with built in Full HD recording do support this standard. The benefit of using a UHS-1 card on a UHS certified device is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write fast enough.However, because these are extra high capacity, sdXC cards, you will need to make sure that your device can support microSDXC cards, and not simply microSD or microSDHC ones. The biggest difference is that the microSDXC standard uses the exFAT file system, rather than the FAT32 or NTFS systems. While most modern Android devices (and in fact most linux/unix devices) can handle that without difficulty some devices, such as older cameras, Android devices, and some Windows devices, may have difficulty with the format.Having said that, I\\'ve been using these in Nikon D80 & D7000 digital SLR cameras, as well as Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S Relay 4G phones without any difficulty, and they read & write fine on my computers. All in all these were a great buy and I\\'m very happy with them. Packaging very secure, product is absolutely legitimate Sandisk card.29.7 GB available storage.[Normal for 32GB card] Amazon comes through again!Speed unknown, works fine in all my **stuff**..Addenda 9-19-13: Two received and working perfectly. The loss of 2.3 GB(32 to 29.7)explained by the data added when formatting the chip.  Seemsto be a legitimate 10 speed. VERY good MicroSDHC! The best! This is a quality 64gb micro sd memory card. It does what it is supposed to do. I would recommend this to any one. I purchased this for a Galaxy Tab 10.1 but didn\\'t like it - I returned the tablet (and accidently left the memory card in it).  So this is the second one I\\'ve purchased, it is now in use in an ASUS T1000 tablet/notebook and I am entirely satisfied. I bought this card because my 32GB Sandisk ultra stopped working in my Galaxy S3.  I tried formatting the card, but it didn\\'t work.  When this card showed up, I read the warranty information, and the ultra series has a lifetime warranty! I emailed the company, and they sent me a shipping label to return the card, and my new on is on the way!  I highly recommend these cards! I found the write bandwidth of this card is 15MB/sec when transferring a steady stream dozens of gigabytes.  The included full sized sdcard adapter appears to be slightly faster than my USB adapter.  I tested by piping /dev/urandom through pv onto the card.  Read bandwidth appears to be 18.1 MB/sec. As expected, SanDisk delivered again with this card. Very fast transfers and a lot of data to use up. Bought it for a galaxy s 3 and it works great. I love the 64GB capacity, and it is compatible with my devices.  I have one in Go Pro Hero3 and one in a Samsung Galaxy 7&#34; tablet. I have this card in my Samsung Galaxy III.It has been in there now for about 8 months with no issues.Okay, it had one issue but that was the phone design itself. It would un-mount if the phone was moved around roughly. It seems to pop out very easy in the Samsung Galaxy phones. So I solved the problem by putting some electrical tape on it to hold it in. So far after 8 months it hasn\\'t un-mounted.It will give you an ungodly amount of storage on this phone. If your wondering if your Samsung Phone will take this card - it will with no issues. It shows a total of 59.6 GB of available space once installed. A must have since most phones come with 8 GB of internal memory nowadays. Bought for GoPro Hero3.  Slips in, works great, keeps up with camera.  Awesome and cheap. Great for smartphones as well! Very fast, very big. Just wish it were a bit less cash so I could buy more for my other storage needs. Doesn\\'t work in my s2 skyrocket but works in my Xoom. Odd but I have to suffer with it. Seems about the same as my class 4. Will not get sandisk again unless its tons cheaper. 1 was stolen by some tweakers which sucks Bought both this and a similar Transcend Premium 300X 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS for a couple of G1WH dash cams.  Both work well with the cameras.  The key is you need cards compliant with UHS 1 or better.  Look for the U with a 1 or a 3 inside it on the card for these cameras.  The Transcend is rated slightly faster but the cameras seem to like either equally well.  When I purchased this Transcend and the SanDisk were within pennies of each other, so aside from slight price and speed differences, there\\'s not much to recommend one over the other.  And so long as you get at least a UHS 1 card, the same can be said for other manufacturers such as G.Skill, Kingston, or others. Bought this to add memory to my phone.  No problems installing and it works great.  Don\\'t know if I could ask for anything more. Gave it 4 stars because I don\\'t know if the problem is the card or the phone.  I have an intermittant problem where the phone stops recognizing it.  But it\\'s fast, and holds a lot.  I would recommend it.Update:  Had intermittant issues with my phone (galaxy s3).  Finally gave up the ghost completely, computer won\\'t recognize it at all.  I don\\'t think I had any important data on it.  I would take it up with SanDisk, as another reviewer indicated that they replaced his over issues in his phone, but my computer can\\'t even recognize it to wipe it so I\\'m not sending it anywhere. Bought it when the price was low. Excellent value. Good transfer speeds and worked on my phone, camera and other devices as well. I use these for local backup (I have 2 for redundancy). I\\'ve had no problems on any of my systems. Added it to my Samsung Note ll and now I have 80 gigs of storage. I have everything in there that was on my other phone and I have only used 5% of my capacity. Great card, great price...can\\'t really beat SanDisk. The brand has never let me down and is well built.  I use this on a Mobius Action Camera and it works wonders.  It also has worked well on my GoPro Hero3+ Silver. Quick initial test with multiple settings from 30p 1080 to 4K 15p recordings successful.Haven\\'t done long recording field use in warm locations yet. Very fast sd card, I really use it for emulators on the Nvidia Shield and it does the job right. I have no complaints everything is in order and i would recommend. I bought this card because I have several devices that use microSD cards, but not all of them are compatible with the newer and higher-capacity SDXC standard. For SDHC memory cards, 32GB is the largest size available under that technology standard, so I went with this one from Sandisk. That way I didn\\'t have to worry about compatibility issues with any of my devices. I\\'ve used Sandisk memory products for a number of years along with many other brands, and I\\'ve always had good results from them. I\\'m happy to say that my experience with this card echoes that of 5,000+ other Amazon users; it\\'s been rock steady, reliable with larger file transfers (several 2GB+ movies at a time), and performed as quickly as I\\'d hoped for a Class 10 card in regards to its read/write times.Aside from the existing reviews and my previous experiences with Sandisk products, I also picked up this particular card due to its UHS-1 compliance. I don\\'t currently have any UHS-1 devices that can take advantage of the increased speed, but for the negligible cost difference, it just made sense. Standards and technology update so fast these days; any future-proofing a product can provide to extend its usable life is always appreciated. Works perfectly in my 738 Samsung. Phone is only USB 2 so I don\\'t know if you really need such a fast mem chip. Can get a lot of stuff into 32 gb. I use for Movies for when I am on the train and don\\'t want to waste my data streaming from the cloud. I got this for my Galaxy Note 3, as it accepts add on storage.  Works perfectly, and I use it to store all my music and files so I dont junk up the phones memory. needed more room on the phone and I picked this card up. Popped it in and let the phone format it, works just fine. Specs say that this phone max out with 32 GB card but that\\'s just not true.  Really glad I got this card, it\\'s fast so when I am taking photo\\'s in burst mode it moves every one.... Not missing out on photo\\'s due to a slow card. SANDISK is a good brand for me and this just worked.  Cant really ask much more of it than that! I had problems using the chip in the reader built into my laptop. It seemed to only want to format up to 32Gb. When I plugged it into my phone, I could format at 64 Gb but then the laptop reader saw it as empty. When I used a USB reader, then the laptop could read it just fine.I was able to copy the 4Gb of data from my old microSD to this chip and have not had any problems with it yet. So far so good - boosts my table storage big time - now I can keep all my pics and music with me all the time - price and promptness was awesome I use this in my camera and it worked initially, but would periodically have it create a bad image file and none of the pictures I took further in that session would remain.  I went to the camera options, reformatted the card, and it\\'s worked perfect ever since so far with over 1000 pictures. This is called &#34;Class 10&#34;, so I ordered it, figuring it would have useable speed. I plugged it in to copy about 9GB of program installation files. I was totally dumbfounded that it took about 3 hours to copy those files onto this &#34;Ultra&#34; &#34;Class 10&#34; SDXC card. (9GB on my super-slow, super-cheap plastic school-kid USB thumb drive takes less than 10 minutes.) So then I tested it on various known computers with typical raw and JPG picture files. Read speeds ranged from 15-25MB/s, while write speeds ranged from 4-8MB/sec for big files, and below 1MB/sec for small files. This is what I would call largely unusable. VERY disappointing. This memory card is exactly as advertised.  Being Class 10 it is nice and fast.  This card has been in heavy use in my GPSr since I bought it, and I\\'ve had no issues with it. I was very excited to add this memory card to my G2 and finally not have to worry about used up memory anymore. This was short lived however as maybe a few months had passed when the memory card refused to write anymore data. I tried formatting it (never could wipe it), using it in a thumb drive reader kwpould not delete data), all to no avail. Luckily the data I had on it was still salvageable. Hey, it\\'s memory. Everybody needs it, and you can never have enough.And, as I\\'m always losing my memory, I have to keep plenty on hand and stashed away for a rainy day. I bought this for my GoPro camera and it works amazingly. No more lag and space for 1.5h of recording in the High ress. quality (not 4k) If you have a GoPro and need a memory card. Use this one. I needed more space for media on my Venue, and this card works perfectly. Reads and writes very fast and holds lots of movies to watch when travelling. got it on time in a simple but secure packaging. inserted it and worked without issues. comes in a clear plastic case with an SD adapter. the is the typical SD case size.the sale price of $16 and change was great as well.love it! It\\'s a good capacity but the speed is slow that is almost 10M...but it\\'s acceptable to me. I like it. Put most of my music and Many movies on it and tons of room for more. Awesome and well priced, at the time of my purchase anyhow. This was a great price for this card, and they are not cheap made. Save several $$$ buying form Amazon, the local stores was a lot higher... Use it in Galaxy s3, note 8.0 and note 10.1. Never had a problem. I\\'ll continue to buy these when I get new devices. Never tried a 64g one. Might. Using this in my galaxy note 2, works great for movies, music and apps, with no issues what so ever. Works on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, but I don\\'t really stress these kinds of things.  I have had no problems.  Have not checked it for heat or any such thing. Phone recognized immediately and it is as fast as they claim.Picture taking used to be painfully slow. It is as fast as I am taking pictures.I put it in my Galaxy Note II. When you buy a memory card, what are you looking for? Additional storage, higher transfer rates, and good prices.  This card is often on Amazon\\'s lightning deals and this is the second one I purchased! I use it in my Nokia 808, which is my phone and camera.  Storing 41MP photos needs a speedy drive, and this one really works wonders!  The additional space is also great for storage! The second one I bought for my laptop, it just stays in there in lieu of an SSD because my laptop only has an 80gb internal drive.  If it were possible, I would definitely install Windows to it, but this laptop will not boot from a memory card.Bottom Line:Need Space? Problem solved, 64gb is currently the max you can get.Need faster transfer rates? For a MICROsd card, it\\'s about as fast as you can get (and if you can get faster, it\\'ll cost a LOT more)Cost? Well, wait for a Lightning deal if it\\'s too much, but the current price really is not bad.5 Stars.Additionally, the SD adapter works perfectly! Including the little lock switch to make it read only if you want. Worked perfect, understandable that only 59gb is usable as this is the case with all memory items I have ever dealth with. You do need to have  the right equipment to use as very few can access these.  Only newer and equipment that CLEARLY STATE can use these will work so be aware. SanDisk is a very reliable name in storage.  This Micro SD card is no exception.  Lots of storage at a good price, this is a must for tablets and cell phones with limited on-board memory. As advertised. Good write and read speeds and works well with new Microsoft surface. Only complaint is there was a significant price drop after I purchased this card. But that\\'s not amazons fault nor the product. ...then Class 6 cards on Samsung Galaxy Note. With Class 6 cards I had some minor speed issues, but with this one they are gone. My Headline says it ALL!  How can U go wrong?  & the price was better that what I was looking for.  If U have read any of my past reviews I hope that they have helped of u\\'re on the fence about a pending purchase or have nothing to base a decision on. Excellent card. It is currently installed in my Samsung GS3 and works flawlessly. Highly recommended but make sure your phone/device will handle the size; some don\\'t like cards &#62; 16GB. This was the necessary addition to the GoPro mini HD camera.  Very pleased with the service and what was advertised.  Will be a repeat customer for sure as I look forward to adding to my video & photography collection of accessories. This MicroSD serves the purpose in every way. If I need another, I will certainly buy another one of these. A fantastic discount and remarkable value for a name brand product that would cost three times the amount that I paid super fast transfer speed. very very impressed with the price as well. I\\'ll be getting another no doubt. Two Words. I have been waiting for these microSDs to not only reach 64GB capacity, but at an affordable price.  Found it!  The package arrived early, worked as advertised, so I am a happy customer. what can I say it\\'s a memory card okay it is fast and compatible good quality perfect perfect perfect perfect I have always had good luck with sandisk memory cards. This one is no exception. Fast works great in my Galaxy S4 and never a problem with any I have purchased. It took 6 days for me to get 2 of these cards when I made the order early in the morning-normally that\\'ll get my product to me the next evening. Not SIX DAYS LATER!Be warned, this was the slowest shipping I\\'ve had for my Paid Prime Account since I started. If you need these cards quickly, buy from a different seller. this class 10 Micro SD card has worked flawlessly,  the adapter has also worked well, but the parts are so small it can sometimes be hard to handle.  worked great overall.  good performance. The first one i received died in less than 2 months. It just stopped reading (lost all that was on the card), but Sandisk customer service was excellent and replaced it. Not so enthused about the speed. Transfers between phone and PC (USB 2.0) weren\\'t impressive in my opinion, slow, but the bottleneck could be the phone, but still... This card no longer is readable by three different phones after only six months of very light usage (very few pictures had been saved to the card), where it was never taken in or out of the phone before it showed signs of dying (thus the death was not caused by excessive handling of the card). Has worked fine, had no problems but I decided to move up to 64 Gig and ordered one. I moved this one to a USB drive I have. I bought this card when I got my Note 2 back in October, it is perfect and fast.  No problems in any way and fully compatible with my device.UPDATE 1/15/14: I bought a second card for my Note 3 and it it excellent.  The frustration free packaging was much appreciated from the other packing last year.  My first original card got corrupted when I put it in an old feature phone but I am confident it had nothing to do with the card in any way.  I have tested these cards with the Galaxy Note 2, Note 3, Note 10.1 2014 and Tab 3 7\" and they all read the card no problem.  I have been extremely satisfied so far. I was able to use this microSD card with my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I just had to format it when it was in the phone.  The only reason not a 5 star is that it\\'s not as fast as the more expensive versions. Got this for my phone. At first it wouldn\\'t work, but the new version of Android was able to format the card so both my phone and computer can use it. I was able to load my sizable music collection and a bunch of books on the card, put it in my phone and use it immediately. As per other\\'s instructions, I inserted it in a powered-off phone and let the phone format it (automatic, after a yes/no dialog). I removed it from the phone and copied  my old card onto it through a card reader on the PC (plus about 20 movies) and everything is working perfectly. Speeds seem outstanding; certainly, copying a 3GB HD movie I copied from my Blu-Ray disc took only a few minutes, even over USB 2.0. Great price for the product. Class 10....good name brand. Way cheaper than at the wireless atore. With lifetime warranty. Too. Works great and is very fast. I recently upgraded from a nearly three-year-old HTC Windows Phone to a Samsung Galaxy S4 and decided to give it a huge memory boost. This card filled the bill perfectly. Add a good file manager to your App collection so you can use it effectively. Recommended.As an aside, I would have upgraded to another Windows Phone if WP8 permitted number blocking for nuisance callers. But it doesn\\'t, so they lost me to Android. This is a piece of crap. This is my 3rd card in 3 months. This is ridiculous.Do not buy this crap I picked this SD card to add some more memory to my phone. This works great and transfers data quickly. If you are in the market for a new SD card, I highly advise you to buy this one. Although Amazon claim it is a C10 ultra fast Memory Card, it actually has much slower write speed than other C10 microSD card (it only scores about 60% of the normal speed). For example, I have tested it against my old Maxell C10 HC microSD card. The test was done by writing the same 3035MB random data from DRAM to empty microSD card through a USB3 card reader. The resulting time was the average value from 3 tests of each device:SanDisk Ultra 32GB C10/UHS1: 5m50.816s means 8.7MB/sMaxell C10 HC: 3m38.787s means 13.9MB/sThe speed is completely unacceptable for a Class-10 claim (13% lower than 10MB/s, the lowest boundary of Class-10 device), even the over-advertisement of SD card speeds are common (claiming 30MB/s for actual 12-15MB/s). It is almost a scam. Some Class-6 card will beat this \"Class-10\" card. It works and will give me much more room for music on my samsung galaxy s4!! I will also be able to use this on future phones which is another plus! Works great with both models of DashCam I purchased.The Blackvue Dr400G-HD and DR500GW-HD.32GB works wonders for a constantly on dash cam, I had issues getting other cards to be recognized by the Nvidia Shield. No issues with this one. Read and write speeds seem good and am happy with this card so far. I use this in my HTC and it works like a champ.  Perfect for high definition videos and music for any smart phone.  Transfer rate is impressive and the price is right where it should be.. Works fine, as SanDisk usually does. I know there\\'s a lot of discussion about transfer rates and so forth, but I\\'m fine if the rate isn\\'t so fast or slow. I really don\\'t care, long as it holds and keeps the data until I can transfer it. All these cards seem to me to be about the same. SanDisk is the big name and so I usually stick with it. But I have other makes that are just as good. Shipped fast.  Works in my camera..  Does store video much faster than my older memory card.  For the price it is a good deal. I havent done speed tests, but this sits in my tablet and lets me store music with easy. It is fast enough to stream HD video from. No complaints matched description, was delivered on time and works well. Would easily recommend this to anyone looking to memory for their mobile device etc Works as advertised for my Samsung GN2 Smartphone.  Got one for my dad\\'s Samsung GS3 too.  Sandisk is simply the most reliable hi-cap micro SD flash memory out there. I had the card about 3 months in my Galaxy S 4 and then it suddenly went into a read only mode. All the data was still there and I was able to copy it all from the card but could not write or format the card. I searched the internet high and low for a solution and then finally contacted Sandisk support. After explaining my problem, they said it will need to be replaced and it would be covered under warranty. The replacement process took about two weeks, they paid for return shipping. I now have the 2nd card and have had it running for about 2 weeks now.We\\'ll see if I just happened to get a bad one or if they all are of questionable quality. Very good for information or Photo storage in a small device, I have 2 so far for different computers and is great. I wanted some extra space in my new mobile device so I chose this SanDisk microSD card.  The card has worked perfect so far in my HTC One M8 for several weeks so far.  The performance of copying files from my computer over to the phone is adequate.  The performance is likely limited by the phone\\'s USB 2.0 interface so I haven\\'t done any tests with the card connected up to a dedicated SD card reader. exactly as described and works GREAT on our Surface Pro\\'s.  Excellent product!  Have never lost any data on one.  TARDIS Good size card and a great price. My only complaint is with the adapter card. The little lip on the end of the micro card is almost nonexistent and the adapter card slot is very, very tight. The only way I could get the micro card out was with needle nose pliers. Had to take a utility knife to the opening of the adapter card so I could actually slide it in an out with ease. Works great in the phone and it had no issues installing it.Great price and works well for the price Received undamaged in protective package within delivery schedule of provided estimate.  Provided adapter not used.  Memory Card inserted in Garmin 5000 series GPS.  Fit good.  Works good. Did not test actual card speed. This is a little gray square, with one corner missing.  It holds just short of 32gb of data, and transfers it at just short of 30MB/s, as expected.  I use in in my cameras, which is what it\\'s designed for, and it works as designed. I\\'ve had Zune music players and with this memory card I could copy all of my CD library and play from my Samsung Galaxy 4.  I forget how many CDs but at least 400 and thousands of songs.  Beats paying network charges and I can move them to my next phone by just moving the card/ Very simple to format and use.  Excellent storage.  Buy it along with a 3.0 compatible USB  microcard adapter for downloading to 3.0 capable computer.  Makes for very fast and hassle free transfer of your pictures. I bought this because I was having problems with other MicroSD cards not working in my Surface RT.  I plugged this in, and it worked fine.  I haven\\'t done a full test on performance, but it appears to work at the expected speed. I bought this for my son\\'s Samsung Galaxy MP3 player(an Android -Version 2.3 Gingerbread device) to replace a class 4 8GB. He was thrilled with the noticeable difference in performance in the device. I bought two cards for tablets.  The first wouldn\\'t format, so I bought another GSkill Class 10. The second worked, but only for 3-5 minutes. Then error, or freeze.  I thought it may have been the tablets.  However, the Gskill worked in both.....So I called Amazon.  The customer service was excellent.  There \"may\" have been a problem with one of their vendors......They shipped out two new cards with Saturday delivery.  It was \"implied\" through lengthy conversation with the Amazon Agent, that there were numerous problems with a particular company/vendor.Lesson:  Do NOT Hesitate To Call And Return if you get a card that seems to have ANY troubles out of the pack.I was surprised that my initial review was removed  from Amazon....So I am leaving another about the return.  II tried everything to fix these cards: fat32 ntfs and the newest exFat.....  There are definitely some damaged cards out there so be wary, and do not hesitate to call customer service! I am using this in my Samsung galaxy smart phone and I did not find any issue. easy to access I recently upgrade my cellphone to the Samsung Galaxy Note II super phone and needed/wanted a larger memory card.  This unit is much better than I could\\'ve every ask for with it performance and reliability. This speedy high capacity memory augmentation recalls more than my 27 years in school. Great price, excellent product. Expect no complaints from your purchase. My gf wanted music on here phone so I got her this, she hasnt put any music on her phone yet so I cant say how well or not this works, but the phone recognized it and its been sitting in there for a couple months now. Love this chip,... bought this for my Samsung S4, it works well and fast.... No issues with it, so I bought one for my mom.... Great item. Runs a lot faster then the cheap ones and still a really good price. Worth the extra money These work great in a GoPro Hero 3+ Black. The memory card runs smooth, and is as it says, class 10. The card also comes at a very good price. Thanks to reviewers, I knew what to buy, b4 we ever got our Galaxy3 cell phones, (gift from my niece), *will be here tomorrow--same day as our SanDisk! Thank you for your time sharing your thoughts and opinions!  It was/is appreciated! I bought this to put in my Olympus PEN E-PM1 camera which takes a standard SD card. Therefore it must go into the adapter to be put into the camera.  Unfortunately there is something touchy about this. Sometimes I turn the camera on and get a card error. Sometimes I can pop the card out and back in and it\\'ll work. This past weekend I couldn\\'t get it to work at all.  I\\'m guessing it\\'s the camera. Or maybe the adapter?  When I plugged the card and adapter into my computer to copy the pictures off, it worked perfectly. So I\\'m not sure what the problem is. I make sure to always carry a spare \"normal\" SD card with my camera in case this one stops working. Just what I needed for more storage on my phone. Don\\'t know why but I\\'ve always bought the SanDisk brand and always been happy with the product. I have a few of these in varying sizes.Deb We ordered two of these for our Samsung Galaxy S3 phones. They work perfectly!  Exactly what we wanted and needed:) No problems I have two and I bought one for a family member. She loves it. I need four more words. I will keep buying it. Thank you Amazon for showing me what type of Memory Card and Adapter that I needed. I love buying everything I need at once to use my electronics purchases. Has worked perfectly since the day I got it. No hassles or problems so far. Holds everything that I would ever want to store on it. I purchased Sandisk because i thought it was the most reliable name brand out there. I have a Galaxy S3 and purchased this 32GB card to handle all my photo\\'s and movies. I\\'d say over the last 4 months I haven\\'t been using the storage for more than just photo\\'s and the occasional movie. The device just failed on me yesterday, losing all my photo\\'s and files. Thank goodness for DropBox auto-photo upload otherwise i would of permanently lost my photos.I actually went back to the Amazon branded microSD card (16GB) which is about as fast and so far, way more reliable than sandisk. I can\\'t beleive a sandisk card failed, I\\'m probably going to RMA the unit and hope they send me a better unit. You can guarantee that i\\'m going to burn in the card to make sure there\\'s no errors.I gave it one star because you think you pay a premium for a premium product. You expect it to be as near flawless as possible. I put in my IdeaTab and what do you know? another 60 GB of space for documents. So far, no issues at all. I bought this to add storage to my 16GB GS4, which only ended up having around 10GB on arrival. The transfer speeds are great, I was able to copy my entire music library over in minutes! very affordable memory with a lot of storage this was an excellent purchase that was worth it thank every one I don\\'t think there is much I can say about this little card/adapter. It was purchased with a Magic Wand Scanner that we use at work to capture images with a quick swipe across a wall chart/map. This card stores plenty of images, it keeps up with the scanner, the adapter works great, and it hasn\\'t failed to store or transfer a image yet. I didn\\'t really need this for my phone but I figured I may as well get it. Got to love 32gb of storage. Works good for when recording 1080P video. this is a great product but with over production comes some small issues at times, my phone will say that my card is damaged sometimes so I have to reboot, not sure if it\\'s the phone or the card, I got 2 of these one for me and the wife, her\\'s never have any issues. I can live with it, it happens every so often ... Seems like a good value, but as yet i\\'ve not gotten to actually use mine;I bought it for a Contour+ camera without realizing that was apparently known to be incompatible. Found that out afterward on Contour\\'s forum. The device itself will support microSD up to 64GB but there is something about Sandisk Ultras that doesn\\'t play nicely. Unclear what, exactlySo I\\'m sure it\\'s great, but you might want to check around to make sure your device will support the thing. purchased in Florida so the price was just fab, the card is excellent and very fast with my Gopro hero 3 and an absolute must Better price than the Samsung branded card and works as well or better. Make sure that you check the requirements of the device that you have so you get the best card for your device. This was what I needed for extra space and to store more music.  This works great on my Samsung S4 Put in camera and started taking picture without even formatting the disk.Although it only recognizes about 29 GBs .  ( makes me think why?)I think there may be some SanDisk Tools hidden on the disk.The bright coloring makes easy to find in the camera bag. SanDisk makes a great big little card. I have this in my HTC sensation 4G ( which it isn\\'t supposed to work in ) and I got the full memory card working. It\\'s great to be able to cary that mush memory on a phone. Great product as promised. Slipped right into my Samsung Galaxy S4 with no issues and I like the adapter they provided in case I want to load data from my laptop directly into the card. I have not done any serious benchmarking around how media performs running off of the card vs. on-board memory but I have not noticed any difference. So far it is working fine with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0. Access to videos and music on the card is very fast. I bought a new phone and got this chip because it was the largest the phone would accept.  I keep a lot of pictures on it.  100% satisfied. Had the 32GB SD Card for a 4 months before it died on me. Tried to swap it out and said warranty was only 60 days long. Last SanDisk product I ever buy. not much to say about this, ordered it to put into my new Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet, plugged it in and it works as advertised. Nuff said! Got here within a couple of days of ordering.  Easy to install and works great.  I wanted extra storage and this was right size for me. I use this (with a Nifty MiniDrive, [...] to extend the built in SSD in my MacBook Pro. I highly recommend it for anyone needing a speedy flash card. It feels odd to give 5 stars to something that disappeared into a piece of electronics, but to be fair, it works as promised, and there is nothing wrong with it.  I use it to store the digital map for my Garmin 810 bike GPS/computer.  The file is about 4Gb in size. The map loads quickly in the Garmin, and I have not had a problem with entering a bike route or navigating one.  I have taken it out twice, a 42 mile ride and a 60 mile ride, and it worked flawlessly both times.  \\'Nuff said. Good price and fast enough to load MP3 files from the computer quickly.  I use these in Sansa Clip MP3 players, perfect match. Yup, this is the chip you need if you never want to worry about running out. I use it with my GoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition on 1080 sw  and it goes for hours, longer than 2 or 3 batteries. Ordered and installed Dec. 2013, it\\'s been working fine since. Some quite detailed reviews here from others on bad experience in the S4, which has apparently been addressed, so seems to be all good now. I have a low-end Android phone and this made using it that much easier because of increased responsiveness and of course, storage capacity. Nice to be able to stuff 20GB of music and movie files on my phone. And still have room to take lots of photos and video. This is a great memory card that I\\'ve put into my phone for music and picture storage.  It works exactly as advertised. Was a really good price on Amazon. I will be using this card to expand the memory in a Garmin GPS unit. Good value. It has great speed and memory for the purpose it serves. I wish my memory was this good. Catch them on sale here on Amazon! High speed, qualitty vendor (SanDisk), high capacity micro sd card. Highly recommended to anyone. Using in my Microsoft Surface and Windows Phone 8. I\\'ve tried several brands of microSD cards in various smartphones and this SanDisk card is by far the fastest and most reliable card I\\'ve used.  Like others have mentioned, I did have to format it using the tool from sdcard.org but once I did, it was faster than any other card I have ever used.  Completely error free and no issues whatsoever this is a great 32 SD card it works real good for my samsong rush and it hold a lot of pictures a lot of videos a lot MP 3 and mp4 4matic songs this is a good SD card I would recommend it to everybody that\\'s why I gave it 5 stars I bouth it in order to extend the capacity of this tablet (64 GB).Now I have 128 GB on my Asus transformer Infinity... Seeing as how everyone in the family has some kind of device that can utilize a microSD or SD card, this item fit the bill and I picked up a bunch to stuff stockings with. These came in a basic white package with the adapter to full-sized SD. 32GB is a nice size, especially for all the new HD smartphones and tablets. I have had better luck with SD cards than flash drives -&#62; nearly all the flash drives I have purchased have died. I have had 3 microSD cards go south on me and zero full-sized SD cards go bad. I installed my stocking-stuffer into a car DVR dash cam where it has been recording my daily drives. Speed testing shows read speeds in excess of 33MB/sec and write speeds of 16-19MB/sec. Should be fast enough for most HD devices. What to be said???  Extra memory chips for my Gopro.  Small and compact for traveling.  They travel and work great BOught this for my underwater camera so i can take more photos and video. now i can take 7000 pictures! lol I have lost my data 3 times with this card. I don\\'t know if it\\'s the card or the S3. My data always ends up as unrecoverable pieces in the LOST.DIR directory the phone creates the first time you insert the card. I don\\'t trust it to hold anything I cant afford to loose.Update: I purchased aKingston Digital 32 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDC4/32GBlast week as a replacement. It hasn\\'t lost any data yet. I\\'ll update here again if it has the same issue.Update 2: TheKingston Digital 32 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDC4/32GBhas been in my phone for 2 months with no data loss. It is the better product. reliably turns my blackberry into a jukebox full of music & video files no buffering or stuttering to catch up Good price good quality, This card works perfectly for my video recorder as well as my Canon 500D. The class 10 really bust up the speed when you need to import the photo or video. Speed squeaks in at a bare minimum of a class 10. Good for tablets and smartphones wouldn\\'t recommend it for Picture or Video Camera\\'s I have had good look with the SanDisk brand MicroSDHC. I still wanted to wait a while before reviewing, usually if these units are going to fail they fail in the first few days/weeks. This has been running in a LG Optimus phone and has been flawless since install. Still have a working SanDisk MicrSDHC 32GB that\\'s over 2 years old, that I transfered from my old HTC to the Optimus and now in my Galaxy S3. great value for money, works as advertised.  it is a sd card what else is there to say.  but this makes me write words Sandisc makes awesome products. If you have a digital camera/camcorder you should only use Sandisc Class 10 memory cards. They are reliable, tough and work flawlessly. Best value for your money!!! It\\'s memory. It works in my phone. I can store files to it. The price was right. If you\\'re looking for 32G, this will do just fine. This is a really great micro SD card! I purchased one for my Samung Tablet and another one for digital video. I mounted this in my S5 and it worked flawlessly from the start. Transfer speed are great using the S5\\'s USB 3.0 capabilities. Shipped as described, Was very easy to add to phone. Works perfect for pictures on my cell phone. Allows me to do more videos with no worries about memory. Works great in my new S5 I love this things. Now I just need to work my phone better so I can use the 32gb more. Over all works great Don\\'t get ripped off buying the same card direct from GoPro, buy it here for less; then you can use the money you saved to buy an extra battery since the Hero 3 battery life sucks.I have a few of these in the Hero 3 Black Edition and it works great on all recording formats and speeds, even the highest resolution ones that require full use of the card\\'s 10 MB/sec rating.  They\\'re very fast to copy files off of into the computer as well.  I haven\\'t benchmarked them because other reviews already have that information, but they\\'re certainly much faster than the old class 4 cards I use for my Hero 2 cameras.I would recommend formatting upon arrival; I did have one initial issue with one of these which formatting resolved.  It\\'s worked fine since, with numerous uses, so I think it was just a missed QC check at the factory.  It hasn\\'t had the heat issue others have mentioned with regard to the few defective ones people have received and has worked flawlessly since so I\\'m not worried about it at this point. I bought this card to extend the storage capability of my tablet. It holds hundreds of my short video files without having to use the tablet\\'s built in memory. Transfer speed from my computer into the card is relatively fast. If someday I may need more storage in the tablet I can always buy another one of these cards. Best deal I could find on fast microSD card.  Seems to work fine in our new Android tab.  Can\\'t lose! yet, but I will be soon. New in case and I look forward to using it!  I don\\'t know what else to say about it! I use this in my phone and transfer information back an forth from phone to laptop. Great for holding lots of items. Have no problems with it and will probably get another or larger size It does what its suppose to do.  I use it in my Samsung laptop, I never remove it so its never a problem. It Works excelent. I can see that is more fast than others. Very good performance. SanDisk demonstrate excelent products in this case. Hello, the micro SD is perfect for my liquid image EGO camera HD, Very fast and great capacity! Excellent,  Recommended Bought the Astak CM-7200...This memory card works great in that with no hesitation for the video..Great pice too..No problems. Thumbs up!! Bought (3) 32GB micro memory cards for the kids tablets. The kids love the extra memory although they do need new tablets now. I bought this for my 6yr old\\'s Nabi tablet. Thing works perfectly allowing him to download music and games with ease. Loved the price and trust SanDisk products. Received my card in a decent amount of time and it was packaged well . The memory card was crispy brand new and in perfect condition . After installing the card in my video camera it worked perfectly! Very good deal. Excellent storage and small!  Works well and does everything I need it to plus it came in at a good price. I ordered this when I saw excellent specs. I thought only the micro chip comes. I was very well surprised when after receiving the parcel found out that it contains also the SD adapter which makes this chip usable in computers,, laptops, etc. BTW Amazon price beats up the same chip found at Costco for about $5 less.Copied the content of the older 16 GB micro SD card onto the new one, swapped the chips and here I go... :)I am using several Sandisk memory chips including compact flash cards for my DSLR. Excellent brand, fast, reliable, does not lse data or have write/read errors. Perfect! I ran the Disk Utility function in Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS.  Minimum Read - 13.7, Maximum read 15.1, Average Read 14.9. That\\'s more than acceptable, given the Class 10 designation. Way less than anything I could get in a big box store. No issues with the card this far. Would buy again and again. We can\\'t beat Class 10 flash memory speeds, at least for now.  This unit works assuringly F A S T and reliably ... for a reasonable price, too.  I have no hesitation in recommending it ... or buying the SanDisk brand, again. I have an older generation SanDisk 32GB card I bough in 2011 and this one is a lot faster!The red stripe design also make it stand out visually very nicely. (I wished the included adapter would be painted in matching colors instead of plain generic black like all other memory cards and adapters.) The last card I got was bad, but at least this one is working properly.  SanDisk is the best brand. I really like this SD card. It\\'s fast and it looks good. Great value too. What more can be said? Works well in my Galaxy Note II.  I\\'ve bought many Sandisk memory cards and never experienced a failure, even the 256MB SD card purchased for a Palm Pilot still works. It\\'s a memory card.  It\\'s tiny, it works. I need ten more words to post this review. That is all. What can I say it is a sandisk (not a knock off) and it works great.  Never buy one that is faster than the max speed of your device or you will be throwing away money.  (or just call it future proofing it for your next device but who knows what we will be using then) No formatting issues here used this for my HTC one MAX and my daughters Galaxy S4 with no problems or crashing or data loss loaded up books, videos and music with tons of space left! A lot of extra storage space with this card. Quality brand name. A bit pricey in my opinion. Great product overall though. Love the large storage space, great when you get a less expensivettablet and make it better than an expensive one. Works good.  What can I say about an SD card?  It stores my video files for my GoPro.  Nuff said I bought this card for my car\\'s windshield mounted 1080P dash camera. When my cam arrived I just inserted a 16gb card that I had on hand. It is a \\'type 6\\' and I didn\\'t realize that it could degrade the cam\\'s performance. After reading in an online forum that &#34;any video or photo application will benefit greatly from a \\'type 10\\' memory card&#34;, I ordered the SanDisk 16gb Type 10 Micro SD card. Wow! what a difference! The stuttering video that I thought was just inherent to the camera itself is now gone. I believe the color rendition is better as well.This card was by far the best price of any supplier. It arrived quickly and solved a problem that I wasn\\'t even sure I had. Great speeds and reliable so no complaints here! Has lasted a few months now in my smartphone which is longer than some other knockoff brands that I have received. Works great (more than I can say for the GoPro).  I do pull it out an put it into my computer using that little SD adapter.  Way quicker to pull 16 GB that way (I don\\'t know why). Spent over $50 and the thing came fast and didn\\'t work.  Neither my computer nor my phone could read it or format it.  I have had plenty of memory cards, so I know to unmount it with software.  Odds are yours will be fine, mine sucked, I\\'ve heard horror stories about other models but this one is good and it really makes life easier and allows for plenty of storage. I had wanted to get the most I can out of my hero3, At the time I got my hero3 this was the recommended card, but there were many problems with people having issues with it. Since then Gopro has endorsed other card and from what I understand changed the firmware to prevent problems.... The problems is only with the 64gb version, from what I read the 32gb and lower versions are ok... Only had it a few days, but so far it seems to work fine. One thing to be aware of - the adapter came with the little slider switch in Write Protect mode. I could not write on the memory card from my laptop because of that, and almost embarrassed myself by asking Sandisk for support - the I realized what the problem was. I give 10% of the blame to Sandisk since the slider has no visual indication at all. A little dab of white ink would gave helped. But mostly, it was me :-) Anyway, just be aware of this if you use the adapter. Sandisk is a very reputable company, and this class10 microsdhc card is quick.  I use it in my Galaxy S3 and it records video and photos without skipping a beat. Working perfectly so far, fit my ZEEPAD Android exactly & is running great.  I recommend this 32 GB Card for any Android or similar device needing additional recording space. Purchased to add to the memory for my Windows 8.1 tablet (Dell Venue Pro) and it works like a charm!  Also, I shopped aroundand it was the best price I found! Got this for my Galaxy Note. I didn\\'t want pay triple the price in the ATT store so I bought here instead. Works great with a Dell Venue 8 Pro. Haven\\'t been using very long but so far it\\'s working great Cameras are getting smaller and smaller at the same time their resolution is getting better and better.  In order to take full advantage of your pixels, your files get larger and larger ultimately rendering small sized picture cards less handy.  Most cameras now let you take a mini-movie which also eats up space quite quickly.This SanDisk card gives you the ability to store considerably more information in a neat small footprint.  If you do want to go with this card make sure it is compatible with your equipment.  Not every camera takes every card so you have to do some due diligence. This product provides me with a stable and compatible storage augmentation for my Android tablet.  A true asset to my needs never used a micro sd card before, theyre a lot smaller than i thought, smaller than my finger nail. i wrote 150 songs to it from my laptop in about a minute. wrote a 750mb movie in under 3 minutes. glad i bought the class 10 card. the agptek 10\" tablet reads from it instantly with no loading. the mobilemate microsd/usb reader works well with it A very cheap way of expanding memory on your \\'phone. I have bought this because of the 8 mp camera on my \\'phone, which means that memory gets used up quickly. This is also a good quality card. I usually find SanDisk products last at least a year before breaking, and even longer if you keep them in the device. I guess I should be happy it failed after only 1 month, because I only lost 1 month\\'s worth of pictures etc.  I bought 3 of these cards for my wife, son and I.  My wife\\'s had a minor glitch, which went away with a reboot.  Mine had a minor glitch this morning, so I expected the reboot to fix it.  No a reboot caused my Motorola Defy XT to tell me the card was blank and needed to be formatted.  My laptop won\\'t even recognize the card when I put the card in it\\'s reader.  After a couple hours of looking for a way to fix it, I have only found that this is very common for this specific card.EDIT: I was very happy with Sandisk after calling them.  They did say there are compatibility issues with CLASS 10 cards and some of the Android phones, and verified my phone is one of them.  They offered free replacement with a card that would be certain not to have the same issue mine just had, and also to attempt recovery of my items from the card.  These are the reasons we buy sandisk in the first place.  They did recommend a Class 4 or lower card to me for this phone.I am leaving this as a 1 star, because people should be aware of compatibility issues this severe.2nd Edit:  As of March 12, this replacement card, that wasn\\'t going to \"be susceptible to the same type of failure\" is losing apps etc.  I am giving this card up.  It has taken my phone and turned it into a device I cannot count on. I purchased this Ultra MicroSDHC Class 10 card for my media player. I wanted to replace my 4GB cardwith this one so I could store more music. I like to have a wide range of music to pick from when I amon vacation or traveling on an airplane long distances. I think I may have bought too much.This card is advertised as water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof and shock proof. I will have totake their word for it. I am not going to test it.Just for fun I put the 16GB MicroSDHC disc (30MB/s Read Speed) into its provided adapter and used itin my cheapo cheapo Toshiba Camileo HD movie camera. Even at the Full High Definition resolution of1080p/30fps this disc performed very well. No stuttering, no missed frames and all this under low lightconditions. Nice. Very Nice. Those are big files at Full HD resolution. Read on...This card is \\'USH-1\\' enabled which means it is the fastest card available (allegedly) and should reachup to a bus interface speed of 104 MB/s; if the electronic device you are using requires it. Of courseif your card reader or device does not support that speed you will be transferring data at your usualspeed. Sort of like saying it is backward compatible but don\\'t expect blazing speeds. You can feeddata through only so fast.Transferring RAW photos and a Full HD digital film can take a lot of time to transfer. Those are hugefiles to transfer so the USH-I enabled disc is perfect for that purpose. They are working on USH-IIwhich is supposed to allow up to 300MB/s transfers. Talk about instant gratification, we are aboutthere.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is a guide by the \\'SD Association\\' with regard to Class ratings and video applications:> Class 2 for SD video recording> Class 4 and 6 for high-definition video (HD) to Full HD video recording,> Class 10 for Full HD video recording and consecutive recording of HD stills> UHS Speed Grade 1 for real-time broadcasts and large HD video files> UHS Speed Grade 3 for 4K video files-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------USH-I overkill for a media player? Probably, but for the price it was a terrific deal to get a Class 10USH-1 enabled card and have the flexibility to use it in a variety of my electronic devices. Hmm. Onsecond thought I may just keep this card for the movie camera and get another \"slower\" one for mymedia player.As usual I have had no problems with this card. Works well, in or out of the adapter, and seems verytough in it\\'s construction. 5 stars for this little power house of a micro card. Works as expected and it was fast, I am hoping this survived being attached to the item it was bought for as it has met its end flying into a concrete wall - the android tablet it was attached to was suicidal oh well - would recommend to anyone - have fun.. Atto Speed rating 2.7MB/sec write and 2.8MB/sec read.That barely makes it class 2, not class 10 as advertised.This is second time I have to return a slow card, I hope negative reviews will help bring attention to the widespread problem. In conjunction with the Meenova adapter and nexus media importer I make use of this for extra storage of media files (music, audiobooks and movies) for my two Nexus models. I removed it from the package, copied a video file from my laptop and played it on my Nexus without any problems or delay. Arrived on time and was exactly as stated.  A good value for the amount of storage.  Will be filling it up with music. Sandisk* is simply one of the best SDHC & MicroSDHC memory card manufacturer\\'s that I have used for a number of years.I have experienced Zero failures, and they are reusable over and over.Also their adapters are quite handy to carry when traveling or at the studio.*Would like to see SDHC cards in the 1 to 5 Terabtye in the near future. Works just fine. Thia card being so big will slow down your phone a little bit but works fine for me Love this card. Wanted one but the retail prices were just too much. Found it here at a fair price and have been using it ever since the first day it arrived. Great buy if you need this one. this is the SDXC, so, it also required new reader that can read SDXC if you want to read in the computerMost laptop since 2012 support this model; however, the older laptops SD slot cannot read this cardIt is safe to buy a SDXC USB reader The card seemed to work well in most devices that I tried it in, but in a Samsung Galaxy S4 it would continue to unmount and mount over & over on the phone - a known issue on the Galaxy S4 forums due to a possibly bad batch of them.  I tried to reformat the card in the phone and from a PC computer, but that didn\\'t help.  Finally I just called SanDisk and they had to RMA the card, which took about 2 weeks from start to finish when I had the new card in my hand.  The new 64 GB card from SanDisk looks slightly different, but still has gray & red on it.  However, it now works great in the Galaxy S4 and hasn\\'t had any unmounting issues now for the past 3 weeks.Good card for pretty much everything else, except in the new Samsung Galaxy S4 phones. Worked like it is suppose to on my Galaxy S3.  With this memory card now I have over 72 GB of storage! I bought this microSD card to expand the storage on my Surface Pro - it works seamlessly and is easy to swap out - definitely a worthwhile purchase. Fast card with the highest capacity you can currently buy in a microSD format. It\\'s probably the fastest microSD of this size also. Works in devices that say 32 gig max...Put one in my Casio 14.1 Mega PixelCamera and it says I can take 12,800pictures... This memory card works well will my GoPro. It records the video without any stuttering and sputtering. I recommend this and will buy more. This is good item it works well on my Phone and I intend to buy more later. So I highly recommend this type. Bought this Micro Memory Card for my smart phone so I could take long videos on phone it working ok Holds stuff, and if you need anything further for a review then I am sorry. If you dont know that this is a memory card and hold stuff then I would recommend checking out something by Fisher Price. My granddaughter\\'s phone was slowing down. She had a 2gb memory card in it and no room for any more photos. She transferred all 499 photos to this 32gb card and has room for many more. Love making her happy! My young kids all filled their tablets with games and needed some space.  These worked just fine.  I like SanDisk.  I would buy stock in their company but I am not a gambling man.  Good ratings on the transfer speed too might I add with it being a class 10. Most people know that Sandisk is the best. Price is more than competitive for the performance. Works fine in my LG phone. perfect price for the 16gb and class 10. I used these in my raspberry PI\\'s they seem to be very fast access and not bogged down. I bought this for my Galaxy S4.  You need to reformat it to Fat32 32kb cluster size to fully take advantage of it in the phone but once you do it works great.  I copied everything from my iPod (about 40GB) to it and now I can stop carrying 2 devices around. My wife\\'s new Galaxy S3 ran out of storage space as we were moving her music library to the phone. Ordered two of these, one for her phone and one for mine. Installed them in a couple of minutes, and they were immediately recognized by the phone. It couldn\\'t have been easier! this company is as about as good as amazon. They offer a great product, great customer service at a fair price. They just work well together, Dont sweat it just buy it, its a no brain er. I bought 4 of these units (yes, at Amazon):  SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A for 3 Samsung Galaxy SIII and one Samsung Note 2, and found that one in the SGIII has stopped working. I tried everything, in a computer, in different adapters - dead is dead. Since the other three are used by non-techno people, I am not sure if they are still working or not.When I contacted SanDisk, they gave me test instructions, which of course all failed the tests. To return, I have to pay for shipping that MUST BE tracked. This will cost around $20 for a $26 item. I ignored this, and shipped with a regular mail. I should not expect anything back, but who knows.For $6 more I have another unit, and I can tell you it will not be a SanDisk Ultra. Oh, well, the average price for the 3 remaining units will then be $34 (33% more than the purchase price).If I get a replacement, I will update this message.Update:I got an e-mail from SanDisk to advise me that they did receive the item and it is being processed. Shipping without tracking cost me $0.65 vs. $20. At least I have to give their customer service (or return department?) credit for being honest. Too bad the memory cards have problems, as SanDisk had an excellent name for providing good quality products. Maybe I should give this another 1/2 star, but there no such thing. I have never had a San Disk failure in 5 different camera\\'s I use from GoPro\\'s to a Canon 60D.  That are great memory cards. Does exactly what it\\'s designed to do.  I\\'m looking forward to transferring it from the phone to my new camera on an as-needed basis. It is as advertised, is in my Tab at the moment and have it about 75% full with no problems! Love it in my new Samsung Galaxy S5 phone. THESE MICRO CARDS ARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!! IVE LOOKED AT ALL THE STORES AND NOONE BEATS THIS PRICE Works great in my GoPro3 camera. No dropped frames so far.Arrived on time. Good price. Would recommend this item. It\\'s hard to believe they can cram 32gigs of memory into a device this tiny and also get good speed out of file transfers to and from it.  It\\'s a good thing it comes with an adapter for larger size devices--I recommend keeping it in that adapter at all times unless it\\'s inside something like a cell phone which only takes the MicroSD size.  It\\'s way too easy to lose something this small.  I hate the industry\\'s mad rush to make everything smaller and smaller with no regard to usability.  Anyway, the memory card is great outside of that, and since my phone does take MicroSD, I just keep it plugged in at all times and don\\'t have to worry about it. It does what it is made to do. It is hard to believe so much memory can be stored in such a small chip. I\\'m using this in a GPS system.  I\\'ve found that they eventually run out of space and can no longer be updated until you insert a micro SD card, so I got it ahead of time in order to avoid that moment of panic when it arrives. Am using this as additional storage on my new Surface Pro.  Works great and seems fast enough for my needs!!! It\\'s a memory card, what can you say?  It was a good value, and has held up its end of the deal. I am using this in a Samsung Series 7 developer build tablet to expand its hard drive capacity (only comes with 64gb SSD). It has worked great so far, and I have been able to install and run software from this SDHC. I have Only Filled this one time, and that was over 140 pictures @1080, and 4 videos to boot...This Holds Plenty of Pictures Using it in my HTC inspire and so far no problems had to format it though, the card is fast and works really well. I\\'m considering buying one for my tablet. Works good with Nokia Lumia 822. Has plenty of space for music, pictures and especially for movies at high resolution. Just dropped right into the phone with no proble.  Disk works great and give me plenty of room for storage. As usual, SanDisk does not disappoint. The speed is incredible, as is the price. Although you can get a variety of different manufacturers, none are as reliable as this one. Works, works perfectly, super cheap... what\\'s not to love?  There are tons of choices and this really does very well at transfer speeds and doubles (or more) your portable space.  Couldn\\'t be happier. Work well with my android phone.  And came at a good price.  No problems whatsoever.  I would highly recommend these to anyone. Great for HD video or high definition cameras, or long-term time-lapse photography projects. Very pleased and would recommend it to others. These SanDisk Ultra microSDHC Class 10 cards work great in my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 tablet and my Samsung Galaxy S3 phones. I\\'ve also used them in non-smart phones, and they work just as well. Fast write/read speeds are HIGHLY recommended to get the best experience from your gadgets and devices, especially when taking pictures/videos, viewing/editing them, opening/editing files, etc. SanDisk has come a long way in terms of quality and performance, and I would not hesitate to buy more of their cards. For its size, this little disk is absolutely amazing. It does everything as advertised and then some. I will buy more of these disks I bought 2 of these one for my phone and the opther for my tablet. you cannever have enough memory great value and works perfectly. SD is always reliable and top of the line quality. I will always buy SD and none other. Great buy. Im using this on my HTC Inspire 4G works well, copies extremely fast, and no lag on Video Camera App. Worked right out of the box when installed in my HTC and can now enjoy HD Video instead of pixelated youtube quality. SD Card Adapter works too; no problems. Extremely recommend for such an affordable yet genuine Micro SD Card. Still amazes me how small this hardware is with such a large amount of storage.  SanDisk is a leader in solid state memory.  I am happy with the reliability and speed of this product and would recommend it to anyone.p.s. The only issue I have with SanDisk is the normally high price; however I got this on sale so I am happy with what I paid. I bought this SanDisk Ultra 32gb micro SD class 10 card for my GoPro Hero 3 camera. It is able to store all my 1080p HD video, as well as .5 second time lapse still photos. I\\'ve never had a SanDisk memory card fail on me. This is a quality product! Works great in the GO PRO. too big for my PC to recognize it in the adapter  though with Windows XP. Have not tried 8 yet. There\\'s not a lot one can say about a micro SD card. This one has this cool red stripe on it. It\\'s Class 10, making it fast. It works. \\'Nuff said.My application was for mounting in a Microsoft Surface RT tablet. I encrypted it with BitLocker to be safe. No problems. Start at four stars.Plus one star, because it\\'s FINALLY a 128GB SD card.  I have been longing for this for quite some time.Minus one star because its performance is spotty.  I\\'ve been using one in a Surface Pro for a couple months now, and while the write speeds will peak at a sustained 15MB/sec, it often slows to 1 or 2, even in the middle of a large file copy.  I assume that\\'s due to typical flash memory erase cycles or something, but I can\\'t imagine it would be at all reliable for recording video to in your phone.In the end, I like it well enough to get two, but it\\'s really only good for mass storage with low bandwidth requirements. It works in my Note 2 smart phone. I don\\'t think there is much else you can say about it. Bought this to add memory to a 16 gig Samsung Gallaxy 3.Easy to install, and was recognized right away by the phone without need to format.Note; the SD to micro-SD adapter that ships with it, is a little tight.When I mounted the memory card in the adapter, It was tight, and very hard to remove, the first 6-7 times. this card works fine with my huawei. my phone recognized it and loaded it with problems. i\\'m satisfied with this purchase. I\\'m using this on my gopro.  I find that my new issue is not filling up the memory but running out of battery!  Thanks again! This worked great in my Samsung Galaxy S4 - plenty of storage for photos, video, and I\\'m not sure what else to use it for yet. It is ok for the price...but occasionally it has to be removed and reinserted or the device reports &#34;no card installed&#34; I think the contacts on these are a little flaky. I just popped this in mySamsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (Pebble Blue)and it works great!  I did not have to format or it or anything. why worry about the packaging.  THis was the best I could find at the time for a name brand class 10 micro sdhc card.  Came with basic packaging and  a full SD card to adapt, which is what I needed.Works great, speed tests show excellent speed for video recording. I have a lot of memory cards for a variety of digiral devices. This is the smallest memory device I have ever owned and 32 GB of storage, that\\'s outrageous... They wanted $99 for a 64GB micro SD at best buy.  I\\'ve put movies, music, SQL Server databases, and files on this card and everything is working great! I bought three of these for my android phones,Mortorola Admiral and LG Optimus Elite. Easy installation and works as described. it\\'s 128gb, what more needs to be said?  I stuck it in my Surface Pro as additional storage space and it does just that, no problems. With a USB 3.0 card reader, CrystalDiskMark shows blazing fast 47MB/s read but disappointingly slow 13MB/s write speed. So you can pretty much forget about reliable 1080P video recording.Update: It is correct that write speed great than 10MB/s is enough for 1080P recording. I need to clarify that the card is very slow when UHS-1 is not enabled. The read/write speeds drop to 13.3/7.9 MB/s. For devices that are a few years old such as Canon T2i which does not support UHS, 1080P recording may not be reliable. This card is classified as \"class 10,\" it should support sustained write speed of at least 10MB/s without UHS. It fails my test, as observed by other reviewers as well. I have rip music from SACD and DSD to put on this microSD and it can playback smoothly on FiioX3 Digital Audio player, no matter how big the file is. I bought these for my kids tablets and for their action cameras. They work in those 2 devices. Some other devices seem to like the slower cards. very nice A must for any device when u need extra space, adapter allows easy transfer of info such as pictures, music or documents Bought for android tablet. The best part of Android is adding these. Works great own 4 of these! Well since 16 GB is not enought for me I purchased this one specifically for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (Which by the way is far better than the iphone 5)... I have both so I can compare and I am not trolling... In any caseThe SanDisk 64gb works perfectly with the Note 2. I transferred the original info from my previous 16 gb sdcard to this in a heart beat. Now I have movies, music everything. Works Great.Dont understand how people can rate it with a 1... Product works as described 5/5 Works great in my modern phone and tablet. However I was unable to use it on my PC\\'s SD card reader. It appears the older card readers are not compatible with Class 10 as both my new cards could not be written to without the operating system (Win7) reporting write errors.I probably should blame the card reader, but it never failed me until trying to write to this card. Card runs great in my Note 2. Not sure how it compares to other ones in benchmark tests now, but there weren\\'t that many options available to me at the time I bought it.Love having 64 Gig\\'s of storage on my phone. I purchased this item to expand my Samsung Galaxy tab3 7.0 memory and it fit well and is what I wanted, I would recommend this item. I bought this product in order to use with my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet. It works as advertised and allows files to be stored on this memory instead of tablets memory. I re-formatted it to use NTFS mode and have not noticed any problems.DS With the onboard memory, plus this expansion card, my android tablet has more memory than my iPad.  Can I tell if the fast memory is really fast?  No, not really.  It seems to be compatible with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, no error messages, so I guess life is good. By default it\\'s formatted in exFAT, so don\\'t expect your devices will recognize it if they don\\'t support this system. The MS standard allows only 32 GB for FAT32. But who cares? :) There are free tools to format all 64 as FAT32. I personally used Linux and got it done in couple minutes. It was recognized by Samsung Tablet Note 10.1 right away. I will definitely buy one more for my other devices. One point to the people complaining about the speed. Both your device and adapter should support the speeds over 20 MB/S. If you try to use/test this card using USB2, then don\\'t complain. :) You got what you wanted. I bought this to create a bootable SD card so that my Nook HD+ could run pure Android instead of the native Nook OS. It works beautifully. Very satisfying purchase.Needed to increase  the storage capacity  of my Core i5 Samsung Series 7 Slate PC which was EM equipped lwith a 128GB SSD.  This 64GB memory card fit the bill perfectly. Did my research. Cconfirmed a Micro SDxc card and  64GB capacity can  work in the memory card slot of my Windows 7 Pro slate device.  Purchased  the memory card at a very attractive price. ( Amazon was offering a daily deal at the same time period I needed the product)  Memory card arrived without delay.  Packaging was very siimple (worry free...for real).  Plugged  SD card in my slate. PC card slot.  Formatted card to exFAT  vs  NTFS ( after more research ).and I was ready to go.  Transferred my photos and music from SSD  to the SD card.  Freed up valuable  SSD real estate for OS use and my Slate PC is again  humming  with lot more  SSD space available. Plays back  music, video & photo slideshows smoothly from the card. Delivers on function.  Very  satisfied with purchase ..and highly recommended 5 stars no hesitation !... A good size and good price for a small camera or phone that takes micro SD memory; this is fast but not hyped as AIIIIGH-SUPER-SPEEDY because it doesn\\'t need to be; it\\'s good for all the standard usages of your average consumer (photos, ringtones, games, lightweight video, etc). I for one have not bought into Google\\'s, or anybody else\\'s, idea that streaming everything is so great.  With all the regressive data caps and sketchy throughput, I never want to rely on something being available to me online.  Much better to have it local.  And with this new card I can finally pack all of my music (~56GB), all of my photos, dozens of reference ebooks, and a few videos to boot and still I have around 9GB free as breathing room for my podcatcher.  The only real bummer with this card is the speed.  Just as I got acclimated to SanDisk\\'s 64GB Extreme Plus level of speed, going back to ordinary class 10 speed that this card has is a little painful.  Luckily playing music or even playing videos doesn\\'t oversaturate the read performance.  What WILL trip you up however is doing a straightforward copy or move operation while you\\'re listening to something.  This card does not seem to handle multiple simultaneous operations without something going awry.  So long as you understand it\\'s limitations and you can live with them, the enormous amount of storage you can pack into your phone or tablet is very welcome.So far I\\'ve used one of these in a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100, LG G Pad, and a Sony Xperia Z1 Compact - all with success. Do you have different devices that require either regular or micro cards?  Have you ever forgotten to bring one?  No worries if you have an adapter like this.  To get both the micro card and the adapter for one low price is fantastic.  If you don\\'t get one, you have no one to blame but yourself! What more can be said?  It\\'s a great card with plenty of storage space to handle or expand your tablet, camera or video cameras needs.  With the included SD card adapter, the micro card can be read in any SD card reader/writer.  It is initially formatted in some format that my Windows 8 Pro MS Surface Pro could read or see.  But from another laptop using the SD adapter I was able to reformat it and make it usable for the Surface Pro.Great card for a great price! Perfect match for my OTG device and Moto G. Solid speed in transfer and play. Holds all my music and video, leaving storage for apps on my phone. Does the job. This item is available almost anywhere, but Amazon had it for the lowest price. My girlfriend needed an upgrade for her smartphone and this memory card works quite well. She has tested it by shooting some sample videos and they came out very clear. She said there is plenty of room for apps, games, photos, and of course, videos. I highly recommend this all who need it. This card has plenty of space and is very fast. It comes with an adapter which turns it into a normal SD card, convenient for dropping into the computer to offload data. I knew buying sandisk i would get a great sd card and its super fast. I really like it in my phone.If you need a micro sd card this one will perform great and not let you down. I use this in my Samsung Galaxy SIII and it has been great. There have been a few instances when the card was not recognized, but simply rebooting the phone fixed the problem. I am unsure whether this is a Samsung issue (probably), or a SanDisk issue, but it has only happened 2 to 3 times over the course of a year and a half. Overall, the write speeds are fast enough that you can record 1080p video directly to the card, which is exactly what I wanted it for. It does come with a full-size SD card enclosure, allowing you to use this in devices that require that type of memory card. Recommended! Always the worry that an SD card is a fake, even at retail stores. But no issues here and the price is great. I\\'ve had the SD card for over 6 months, and use it in my Galaxy S4.  It has never had any issues, it transfers data pretty quickly and 32GB is a good amount of space.  Great price too! It\\'s a memory card. It holds info. 62Gigs. Can\\'t say more. Lower cost would be good, but it works just as it should. I have been using the same old 4gb card since I had a Motorola SLVR. I figured it was time to upgrade, I\\'m glad I did. The speed of the class 10 is a major difference in my smartphone. From taking pictures faster with less lag in between shots to shuffling through my music without a delay. Highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade. With that being said, beware of fakes! I originally purchased one off of ebay, not paying attention to its location. It came shipped directly from china. It was DOA! Luckily I managed to get refunded through paypal. Didn\\'t have that issue through Amazon though! Haven\\'t used it yet.  It\\'s my first encounter with a Micro.  Appears to be a quality product, though instructions for using the adapter would be welcomed.  Good cost and fulfillment.  Expecting it to function as advertised based on SanDisk\\'s track record at our house. I bought this card as a music expansion for my Samsung S4 and it handles that task deftly.  I don\\'t know how it would work in an intense need of speed environment, but it\\'s perfect for my purposes. If this was any more worthless, it would have a retched stench.  This card has completely turned me away from ever trusting another SanDisk product again.  I would only use this in the future to keep corrupt mis-information to frustrate anyone attempting to acquire any of my data.I have reformatted it 3-4 times IN FULL using various allocation sizes and operating systems.  It only functions under Windows, it randomly works in my mobile devices.  Now i\\'m left to decide if I want to bother researching this to better understand the problem in the future, or simply purchase another card from a more reliable manufacturer...... hello Kingston. Works as expected.  I suspect this is why so many people trust SanDisk.  I hope they stick with maintaining the integrity their products have earned.  I often pay a little more from SanDisk but I have never been disappointed with their products as I have others like ADATA.  In fairness to ADATA, who failed to make good on any of the several defective products I purchased from them, I have never had to test SanDisk\\'s warranty as I\\'ve never had a failure.  Perhaps their product support is just as bad as ADATA\\'s but I\\'ve never had the opportunity to test it! Solid performance and great transfer speeds - enough said. I strongly recommend this card just for being a class 10 and at a bargain price. This is a great buy. High quality and tons of space for any meaty music collection or couple it with videos and pics aas well. Can store roughly 60 movies on this little microSD card. Tons of music. Highly recommend this. I bought this SD card for use with my cell phone. It worked really well and as far as I could tell, transfers the data at a fast rate. No complaints. This mem card is fast and does exactly what is supposed to do...save pictures quickly and have plenty of room for more. I bought this for my Samsung Note tablet 10/1 to store movies and books. I haven\\'t watched a full movie on it, though I have watched a full TV show without issues.  I don\\'t really do anything else that needs speed, so I can\\'t say how fast it is. I bought this for my Samsung Note 3 so I could store my entire music library on my phone. All I had to do was pop the cover, and put it in the microSD slot, and it worked perfectly! My phone now has 96GB of storage. Take that iPhone! I\\'ve got a number of SanDisk brand products.  None has ever failed me over the 10+ years I\\'ve used them.  That\\'s saying something these days in electronics.This card is performing well, and keeping up with the data storage devices I am using it for (one video recorder, one scanner).  Somehow, I would expect nothing less, but then again it is good to know that quality is consistent. Works very well with my new Tab Pro 8.4&#34;.  Have been able to download lots of content from YouTube to watch on long flights. Will use it on any device that takes sd cards.  Very happy with it. Besides blowing my mind that 32GB of data can fit on a chip this small (and also, magnets...how do they work??), there is nothing particularly special about this product. It works as intended, and it\\'s cheap. SanDisk and Kingston are my go-to\\'s for all things data-storage. It is exactly what it is advertised to be. Shipped fast, and I love the converter that comes with it so I can plug it into my computer. I big problem I have been having lately is finding a trustworthy source for SD cards. They are manufactured in China and these rip off companies are selling fake cards at a competitive price, but don\\'t be fooled. If the price seems unbelievable that is because you will end up with a card that is not only less capacity then you are paying for, but a lower class and sometimes a faulty card altogether.When it comes to storage, pay the extra cash to get something reliable. Like this SanDisk Ultra 64 GB SDXC Class 10 memory card. It is blazaing fast and works well in my HTC EVO LTE Android phone.Side note: This card brings my total phone storage capacity to 158 GB. That is 158 GB that I have full access to. 85 GB of which is synced to the cloud. I bought this for my Galaxy S4 to expand the memory capacity a bit more. It works as it is intended to do, fast transfer rate, no problems so far. I got this to expand the memory storage in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. The tablet and paperwork claim to support up to 32GB, but other reviews for these cards and the Note 10.1 said that a 64GB worked just fine. And work just fine it does.I store mostly music on here, as I\\'ve got over 22GB worth of music, which would have taken up most of the 32GB built in to the tablet. I also use my tablet for sheet music, so I needed to have the capability to have all that on there, too. So this was my best solution, and so far it\\'s worked wonderfully.And, on top of that, it came with a MicroSD card to SD card adapter, making file transfers even easier. Overall, I would highly, highly recommend this product! Work perfectly in my camera. Reads and writes fast. I have several devices that use micro cards, so I buy these in anticipation of needs in the future. So I am not going to test this to see if it works when I get this. Most items I buy at a good price. Now if I am loading up cameras and recording gear for a trip or maybe a day at Le Mans. I will check them before I travel, as I check batteries and spares and chargers.So far I have not had a problem with SanDisk, I am gearing up for a trip, my destination is a bit in question at this point. Nice product,has plenty of space and is very quick and easy to use,it is also nice to have thereafter so you can use on many optional devices this product has worked well with my go pro 3 black edition not slow or glitchy love the products and do reccomend This card is awesome and even seems to make my phone run faster, I would say that it is a must have for all!!! If you have a Contour camera you want to use this with. It will not format! Don\\'t even bother.Now I have room for about 16,000 photos. Not what I wanted. It has such a large storage capacity in such a small package. Store all your photos and data on this. Fast recording/downing speed. You can\\'t go wrong wit this. It also can be used with my smartphone.I would recommend this to a friend. Excellent used to upgrade the capacity of my ASUS TF-700-X tablet, has greatly enhanced the abilities of the tablet, easy to use and to transfer information as necessary. I bought this for use in the GoPro Hero3 Black Edition.  It has excellent storage and R/W speeds.  I have filmed at 1080p w/ 60fps and shot pictures at a rate of 30 pictures/ 1 second and there were no issues at all.Excellent product, especially for this camera. I\\'ve seen several recent reviews complaining about not getting any packaging with their SD cards.  One person even questioned if the card was new or not.  Amazon offers &#34;frustration-free&#34; packaging for many of their products where they take care of opening it for you, then they repack it in plain brown cardboard to make it easier on the consumer.  This card has the option to come in the retail packing, or in amazon\\'s &#34;frustration-free&#34; packaging.  It\\'s an ordering option, and it seems this option defaults on &#34;frustration-free&#34;.If you order the retail packaging option, it will look just like it does on the store shelves. SCAN  DISK 32 GB MICROSDHC  C10/UHS 1 MEMORY CARD WITH ADAPTER WORKS WELL FOR ITS PURPOSE,PLEASEDWITH PRODUCT NAME BRAND.AAAAAAAA++++++++ Works just fine. Haven\\'t had any issues. Bought another 32gb micro sd mini but haven\\'t used it yet. So far I\\'m pleased with the purchase.Ordered the hassle free packaging and the card seems legit. Decided to order the retail packaging for the other card since I read stories about fakes being shipped to people. Speed is great.  Works great.  Works great in everything I have tried... and to be honest, My wife thinks I am creating  the &#34;Disneyworld&#34; of electronics with all the goodies I have bought.  Well, they are my toys (for a very old juvenile) and this memory makes them a lot better. I put this in my Galaxy Tablet and increased the memory by 32gb.  It is hard to believe there is that much space on something so small. i give this memory card a 5 star because it works like a charm easy to use plug and play. The packaging is easy to open so you don\\'t have to worry about damaging the card itself . Slipped it right in my Samsung galaxy S-3 maxing out the card slot with this SanDisk 64gb but it only displays (59.47gb) its stable and fast works really good. didn\\'t have to format anything or do any extra steps to use it. i recommend this to everyone Always bought Sandisk memories for my cameras and still satisfied. This time bought for the Galaxy SIII. The speed (Class 10) and reliability are worth.--Sempre comprei mem&oacute;rias da Sandisk para minhas cmeras e continuo satisfeito. Desta vez comprei para o Galaxy SIII. A velocidade (classe 10) e confiabilidade valem a pena. Bought two of these. One for my Galaxy Note 3 and one for my wife\\'s Samsung Charge 3.No pre-formatting was required. Simply take out of the case, pop into your phone, and they were recognized within seconds. Actual space is 59 gigabytes and some change, which is right on the money. I have always had good success with SanDisk and this one didn\\'t let me down. I use it in my Camone POV and it works well. Disk works as expected, we rarely fill it up before purging contents. Arrived fast, unpacked easily, installed quickly, operates without problems.  I am happy with the purchase. It\\'s currently installed on my Samasun ATIV Smart PC Was able to copy all items from old memory card to this one. plugged it into the phone without formatting it and works like a charm. I have the Galaxy S3 This memory card worked well in my Samsung S3 and was instantly recognized.  I didn\\'t have to do a single thing aside from installing it. Came too late in the ski season but will be mounting it on my bike helmet this Summer and then again when the ski season starts on my ski helmet. I use this in tandem with a NiftyDrive on my MacBook Pro. For those of you who don\\'t know, the Nifty Drive is a small adapter made from machined aluminum that fits seamlessly into your Mac\\'s SSD slot. With a 128 GB Micro SSD you can add hard drive space very inexpensively. I put my entire DropBox folder (over 100 gbs) on this thing, and it is every bit as fast as the Mac\\'s internal SSD. In fact, I think it might be faster. Bought this for use with a GoPro 3 black. It works as advertised and has plenty of room for photos and video. I have yet to fill this card up recording time-lapse for a period of 24 hours. I bouthg this memory because in my contry not to many stores seles good product... and I well buit again over and over... iplication on my phone wrock great... whet i get a chance... i well by the 32g... This is the fastest SD card i ever own, 30mb/s i recorded full HD videos... And this card help me a lot with it. Sandisk cards seem to have the least write errors in my experience. This was at a great price too, so it is a win win. The price for this 64GB micro SD card is excellent compare to retail. The card is reliable with no issues at all. I bought one for my Samsung Note 8 tablet and Samsung Galaxy S4! Using this on a Galaxy S III. Works just fine with stock TouchWiz and custom ROMs. Haven\\'t had any corruptions or lost files. Purchased it once it hit the $50-$60 range and looks like it\\'ll stay there for a while. It\\'s amazing to have a 128gb micro sd. Works with my Samsung Note2. I am using it on my YOGA 2 Pro with modified nifty minidrive This card was great! I originally bought it because it was cheap for being a class 10 card and having 32GB of storage. No problems so far.Pros:Cheap, most other cards would cost a lot moreClass 10, 32GBFastWorks on smartphoneCon:None so far memory card failed mysteriously overnight, not sure why, but phone works fine with a different card.here, four more words Bought this to expand my HTC Sensation.  Still haven\\'t loaded completely, and still not sure how well the sensation will organize 64gb of music.  Probably won\\'t replace the iPod, but is an awesome little chip which adds tons of possibility to a otherwise great phone.  Didn\\'t have any problems with formatting or size limits. I have alway bought this brand, for some reason about a month ago I got some other brand, bad move!!!!! I ended up getting my money back, then I bought me this one, works like a champ, this is way to go!!!! Bought this to use with Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (Verizon) and works wonderfully.  I did not need to reformat.  Just pop in and ready to use.  Didn\\'t get the same speeds that the manufacturer says but more than I need to stream media from it. Love having all this extra space available. Sux that in future phones, Android is moving away from SD slots. I love having physical storage available, if I delete something from the cloud I can\\'t recover it. With this that\\'s not a worry.The only reason I didn\\'t give it 5 stars, is because sometimes it feels a little slow. but it\\'s nothing I can\\'t deal with. This is a very good microSD memory, i use it in an Android 4.0 phone, it sees 29.71 GB of space. It was recognize immediately by the phone and it does not freeze when i\\'m playing a videogame (like Asphalt 7). The design is very cool too. I like its speed. I would recommend this memory to any smartphone user. I bought this to expand the memory on my MS Surface, it works perfectly, my music and photo are perfectly stored and it works like a charm Very fast, reliable product. I use it every day in two computers, saving multiple files from one pc and moving them to another as backup. This makes a great supplement to not having the latest greatest SSD. I keep some personal documents on my work laptop on the micro SD card to save space on the primary SSD. Love this SD Card. I have had such great results from it. I could not be happier with it. Love the price I was able to get this for. I have bought them before and will probably buy more. I don\\'t think I will ever buy anything but the ULTRA series sd cards. This is a great microSD card. It is fast and the 16 gb gives me lots of capacity on my smartphone. Copied all the data from my phone 16GB sdcard to the new 32GB and everything worked fine the first time the card was installed. I had previously done the same with an 8GB to 16GB with same results. It does not increase an speed to the phone as it is controlled by phones operating system, I love this product.  The space is perfect for my device and it runs really fast.  I thought it came at a great price too.  I highly recommend this product! This card seems to work well ,enough speed and so far it\\'s working just fine ,good value for great quality ,LHB I bought this and the 1/2 size adapter for my MacBook Pro.  It fits right into the SD slot, nice and flush.  It has a little handle to use to remove.  But I love getting the extra 64 Gig of memory and use it all the time. The sd card works perfectly. I use a samsung galaxy s3 lte and the sd was recognized without problems. I did not need to format sd. Just plug and play.Ups sent me the shippment in 3 days. I recommend the product and the provider. Works as expected. I was able to successfully upgrade my samsung galaxy s4 memory. Now my photos/videos are being saved to the SD card. very good product, excellent quality, is the original and it works perfect on the phone. I recommend it to anyone who needs a good memory for your phone. This card is exactly what I was expecting. It fit perfect in my tablet. I have enough memory to add my playlist of songs. I\\'m into photography and I just got a gopro.This micro sd card is a class 10, it\\'s great for photo/video and the best thing that I has, the price. I went to bestbuy, walmart, target, even a CVS looking for deals and BE AWARE, you\\'ll find micro sd cards &#34;on sale&#34; but none of them -class10-. The cheapest I found a class 10 of 16GB was around $40.So be smart, get this with time and wait patiently. Got this memory card for a good deal. I\\'m using this on my samsung galaxy s4. So far I never filled up the memory card and still have at least half of free space on this card. incredible speed, phone recognized it within moments. I was able to transfer all my books music videos and everything onto my phone and have room to spare without having to worry about a fully consumed memory card. arrived a day earlier than I even assumed.pros:incredible speed.Class 10exactly as orderedtons of storage!cons:I\\'ll be serious, nothing wrong at all here. I got this item for my dash cam which is in my convertible. The dash cam is recording at all times when I am driving my car so I needed a lot of memory. This card does the job for me and this brand name is fantastic, no problems, and works as it ought to! What a great find under $50. It works perfectly for my tablet for extra storage for photos. do buy this. This went into my new Samsung Galaxy Light cell phone to store my music files and my cell phone photos. Zero problems. These SD cards just work (until the don\\'t). SanDisk is a top brand and I have no trouble recommending this. Look through the many dozens of other recommendations, too. Class 10 UHS-1 is one of the fastest protocols available currently. I got a card and it wouldn\\'t let me copy files to it, it would (a) not recognize on any of the three computers or my android tab at home, and (b) unmount itself in the middle of file copies.  These two things happened randomly.  I got a replacement, but it suffered from the problem of letting me format it (yay, farther than I got with unit 1), then crapping out 300mb into a file transfer.AVOID THIS GUY. I was shopping for a class 10 microsd for my gopro and Staples, OD, OM sells theirs for more than Amazon. Bought this and works well with my cam. Comes with a SD adapter. Works well in mySony PCM-M10 Portable Linear PCM Voice Recorder with Electret Condenser Stereo Microphones, 96 kHz/24-bit, 4GB Memory & USB High-Speed Port - Black Happily nestled in the memory slot of my Nook Tablet and performing as promised.  Now, if only the Nook memory slot were easier to access....  All well.  The card arrived on time, well packaged, and has been chugging right along for two months now.  I would definately recommend it to any lover of video, music, or other space consuming files. Works great in my Galaxy S III.  I converted all my \"good\" music to .flac files so I have lossless playback using the Android GoneMAD player and couldn\\'t be happier.  Transfer speed it good and there are no hickup when playing back these 45M+ audio files. this memory to buy a video camera and a cell the probe with camera and battery first just the memory capacity My ipod finally bit the dust, so I bought this card to use in my Galaxy 4 so I could use it as my new music player. It was very easy to transfer the music and get it playing right away. I can\\'t complain at all, it was nice to be able to expand my storage on my phone enough with this that I didn\\'t have to go buy another ipod. I have A LOT of music and this thing holds it all and doesn\\'t slow my phone down at all. No complaints here, I actually bought another one of these for my Galaxy Tab so I can keep all my music on that too. So it\\'s safe to say I would buy it again. Well I was almost going for less space memory for my Sony Xperia ZL, but wow 32 GB of memory is a must these days I love my choice and this product works very good! Excellent. A great chip and works fine in my camera and a tablet if you are just streaming music from it, but if you are putting this in in something high demand like a Raspberry PI or CuBox-i the higher speed chips are better. Fast, easy, and great amount of capacity!!! XC is pretty quick and I am enjoying mine on my Galaxy S4 :) I bought this as an expanded/backup memory for my tablet (a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3), and it installs easily, works quickly, and even has a great SanDisk memory app that helps me organize my files and see a visual representation of how much memory is taken and how much is free.It came with an adapter so I can plug it into my computer to transfer files if I want to, which is awesome.  Nothing bad to say about this memory card! I use this in my surface RT to store movies etc for the kids and be sure that it wont be tampered with This will work on an I717 note, just need to know how to get it to work,they say that the note can only go up to 32 gigs but that is not accurateI got this one to work on the note 1just format this with your computer with fat32 32kband presto you now have a lot of space for whatever you wishjust download the free version of easy US partition master and format the card using the settingsFAT32 with 32kbit worked for me I\\'m not sure what I can say about this that will be helpful. We bought this 6 months ago. It worked when we bought it. It\\'s still working. I can\\'t say anything about speed since we haven\\'t tested it. We\\'ve never had any issues with speed though. I trust SanDisk. Everything we\\'ve bought from them has been good. What can you say beyond the headline.  It works as expected.  I would buy more when I need reliable storage. Excellent. Got 2 of these but still testing to see if speed is its greatest deal. Anyway Cheap at the time. I added 128bg with two San Disk Ultra 64GB memory cards to my PSP with a micro SDXC Adapter to the memory stick duo. Got a couple of these cards for storing music files on my mp3 player, and for transferring things between cell, tablet, and PC. They are fast and, they\\'ve been working good so far. Last but not least, the black friday discount was great. This sd card works great! I haven\\'t had an issue with it since I bought it and I don\\'t expect to have any issues at all! It is almost unbelievable that these micro SD cards can range in sizes up to 64Gb !  and at a class 10 to boot. Pun intended.Comes with the SD adapter, so it will work in any device that uses and SD or Micro SD memory card, just be sure to check whether or not your device can handle the extra memory. Some devices with recognize only 8 Gb or 16 Gb, which means that unless you check with the manufacturer, it is your fault you bought the wrong size memory, and you will not be able to exchange due to YOUR MISTAKE.This card used to cost upwards of $120 not that long ago, and now they are ridiculously cheap, especially for the quality and capacity you are getting.Thanks Use it as my windows file history drive. It is fairly fast, easy to use and durable. I\\'ve also used it as a normal SD card with the included adapter. Fast and reliable. Have worked with it for around 2 months now and nothing to complain about.Good fit for my Asus TF700 With prices of tech items always dropping, getting the bleeding edge stuff usually costs a bit more. Thanks to Amazon and the ability to find deals like this, it was worth while getting the 64GB micro SDXC for my phone. I removed the 32GB I had in there for my Phantom 2 vIsion that had shipped with only a 4 GB unit.  Class 10 is where you want to be when using this for any video recording and you can always count on SanDisk for quality! Pretty good price, great performance! I\\'ve been using micro SD cards for years, tried many brands mostly cheaper. There is a reason they\\'ve been around and will continue to be! If your not sure what card to use in your GoPro this one works fantastic. The majority of stuff Ive seen researching it points to these. With the exception of some issues with the 64GB. But I cant validate that and Im not sure its still a problem. Ive been using these for about 3 years now with no problems. I was out of space on my Droid RAZR 16GB and still had an empty microSD slot, so I figured I\\'d pick this up seeing as how it is a reputable brand in flash memory. I am glad I went with the Sandisk Ultra, because there is seemingly no difference in speed between this drive and the built-in internal memory of my phone. I record a lot of videos with my phone and I\\'ve been recording straight to this card in HD with no problems at all.Installation was a breeze. I took the memory card out of the package and inserted into my phone. Then my phone brought up a menu asking if I wanted to move my music, videos, and photos to the memory card. I selected all three categories, and in minutes it had moved all of my media onto the memory card. I didn\\'t even have to do anything else. I had read some other reviews that said they had to reformat the card or mess around with moving files by hand, but I didn\\'t have to do any of that.I haven\\'t tried using the included SD adapter yet, but I imagine it will work as well as any other adapter. The adapter and memory card were both shipped in a little clear plastic case, which makes it easier to carry the adapter around with you. So you have it with you when you need it.The price on this card when I bought it was a few dollars more than the generic brands. I decided to spend a few extra dollars on it since I would be really upset if I lost all my photos and videos due to a corrupt memory card. I am very satisfied with the product and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of their phone or anything else this would fit in. Good value for the money. Performs like a SanDisk and with the piece of mind it won\\'t fail. First, it is 64 GB. The volume is enough. In addition, it can fit every device for me. I love it. Functions perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy Tab II.  No issues with slow processing times.  Great product, I highly recommend this memory card for tablets. I had to return this and get another one, as the first was faulty. I hear this is semi-common.Must not have enough testing, i might suggest buying two and returning one if you are in desperate or sudden need of one of these chips, no matter what size. Works fine, but it is becoming very annoying that even with flash devices you buy 16GB but only get 15GB. Why not just label it as the exact size? I installed this micro sd in my Asus TF300 Transformer and it worked even though the tablet only supports up to 32GB. This added 60 GB of usable space. I like it comes in handy fits good with my Galaxy S5 smartphone, no problem with filing data on a computer. What can you say about a memory card. I took it out of the package. I put it in my GoPro. I turned the GoPro on and everything worked. Ok so my Dad needed a MicroSD for his GS3 (Galaxy S 3) because he was using way to much space with videos and pictures; he isn\\'t one of the most tech saavy people in the world so I got this for him. Does it work yes it does and very well I might add. Like I said my Dad doesn\\'t work to well with tech and if a MicroSD slowed his phone down when it saved pictures or videos or ran apps from it he wouldn\\'t be happy and wouldn\\'t know what to do with the problem. This card experiences no lag (3 months in) the UHS-I speed class really lives up to its potential here. Best of all, perhaps a little known fact to most of you, this card is waterproof, so you get your phone wet and it dies, don\\'t worry this card is still perfectly fine just pop it in a new phone and there\\'s all your stuff! No cons as of yet will update as needed. Relative needed a new sd card, an upgrade from her 8gb and this did the trick. Great for any phone. Not bad, I doesnt feel any quicker than a normal 32GB card.  And you only get 27GB of storage. 20 I love this Micro SD because I used it as my main memory phone mostly because the Galaxy S4 it comes with a 9GB of free space. So I can pretty much just enjoy this Ultra 64GB for Music, Photos and Movies but not for Apps because my phone is not compatible with moving apps to the SD it stills works for other phones but not this one. I have to say this is one of the fastest Micro SD I ever bought recommended a lot. Plenty of room for all my photos, music and random documents I decide to load onto my phone. It works great with my HTC One M8 and apps stored on the SD card run as smooth as they did on the phone itself. File writes were as fast as I expected from an XC I card.The only downside, and this is minor, is the MicroSD adapter it comes with seems a little cheap. But hey, that\\'s not the reason I bought this card. Works well in Samsung S4, laptop & HD video camera.Replaces SD that caused weird losses & errors in Samsung SGH-M919 phone.  Several other SD cards have refused writes, lost data or had mount problems. SanDisk 32 GB memory has worked perfectly in several devices & 3 operating systems. I purchased 2 of these, 1 for my HTC Incredible phone and the other for use in a key chain storage device. Both of these cards run very very hot.  After copying over 4GB of files, it was almost scalding to the touch.  But both have been reliable with only a few issues of reading them, both times in the thumb drive adapter, so that may have been at fault and not the card itself. Could not figure out why this card crashed multiple times in my Samsung Galaxy SIII, and demanded a reformatting. Then after 5hrs of calls to Sprint & Samsung I got a guy who reads factory stuff!Samsung Galaxy SIII is a Class 4 & Class 6 supported Motherboard, with Qualcomm processor. The Sprint stores only sell Class 4 memory, and there is a reason that Camera memory~Class 10 is not sold there, the board, just like in a PC, has to support the data stream. It does not!If you have an Android Phone you better make sure the motherboard supports it! Even Samsung\\'s USA website does not tell you the board supported memory! They won\\'t, and don\\'t tell who the board manufacturer is in this Galaxy SIII phone. I asked at the Texas Samsung advanced tech support center after 1hr on hold, and they had no specs to even share. They don\\'t get it!PASS IF YOU HAVE A CELL PHONE, UNLESS YOU GET IT IN WRITING FROM THE MOTHERBOARD MANUFACTURER OF YOUR PHONE. I went through this same stuff building custom PC\\'s with Intel motherboards. Memory has to be built to run on this board, at this speed, with this processor, or it will not work properly, and will crash, and lose data. I purchased this card to be inserted into my new Blackberry Z10 smartphone. at first the card wasn\\'t recognized, but after formatting from exFat to NTFS (I know, I know, the warnings told me that hell would open up and eat me if I did this, but im not scared at all) it worked flawlessly.  would buy (and reformat) again I bought this memory card for my Galaxy Note 8. It\\'s a SanDisk and worked great. The card was recognized quickly and I put all my music, videos and other files on it to save room for my internal memory. The price was also very good. Not ok with GoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition. The speed of this card is below other brands\\' class 10 standard. When I use this card with GoPro and Pro-tune on, it will stop recording after 20 mins or so. I already returned this item and bought the Samsung class 10 memory card instead. I operate a commercial whitewater rafting company and we buy these bulk whilst renting out GoPro\\'s and selling the footage along with the card to the customer. We\\'ve never had a bunk card or any problems whatsoever over about 40 cards so far. I was advised by my gopro rep to be sure to buy from a name brand &#34;like sandisk&#34;. The adapter is well appreciated by the customer, not only because most people don;t have a port for the micro format, but also because microsd is so ridiculously small that its far too easy to lose.Have and will buy again. Bought this to add to my daughter\\'s new ASUS Transformer. Excellent access and storage speed. Work good I bought this for use in my Blackberry Z10. It works great for me as I hold all of my music from iTunes and my most precious pictures of my wife and kids.No problems whatsoever with my Z10 It is what it is and it works as required and is very fast in processing the data.  In the 2 weeks I\\'ve had it it hasn\\'\\'t crashed.  :-) Bought This For My Samsung Galaxy S3Load It Up With Music And It Works FlawlesslyI\\'m Very Satisfied With This Card I purchased this card (the 64GB version) to use in a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone. It worked perfectly for almost three months, at which point it just stopped mounting. The phone detects a card, but is incapable of formatting it. It\\'s even worse on my computer, which does not even detect the card anymore (and yes, I\\'m using an SDXC-compatible USB reader).I contacted SanDisk for an RMA and they will probably replace it, although the replacement process is needlessly slow and painful.I had bought this card based on the glowing reviews, but I\\'m going to stay away from SanDisk products from now on. Great with the galaxy s3 didnt have to do anything special just transfer any file fast and got it going must have for s3 phones.verizon S3 This card is quick and responsive. I love that it loads much quicker than my other cards. Also, the price is great! 32gb, this is just what the doctor ordered. Take 32gb and call me in the morning..The ultra runs fast and has lots of capacity for your electronic needs. Seller is great getting package out quick. Price was right! Highly recommened.. When researching reviews for best memory for the GoPro we read that some people had issues with this card, but possibly could have been the \\'mobile\\' version, which was not a true class 10 card.  So far, no issues with this card, recording, uploading, etc... Works perfect. No complaints. It\\'s fast. That\\'s why I bought it. It does what it says it\\'s going to do I have always been a sandisk guy.  This cards works both in my note 3 and s4, gives me 119gb after format.  Can\\'t ask for much more, including the fact that sandisk stands by their products and has excellent customer service.  I could never imagine buying  a micro sd , sd , or ssd from anyone else. I hate it, it worked fine for 2 months and the after those 2 months it started with problems, first, every once and a while was not recognized by my device, and now 4 months after, I have to pull it out and then place it again in every hour.....It might have been just my microSd problem.... But I wont purchase one of this ever again They\\'re nice cards. They\\'re fast, come from a reputable brand, hold 32GB in a card the size of a fingernail, and really don\\'t cost that much anymore. There are several brands of cards you can choose from, but I always liked SanDisk. I haven\\'t had issues with their products.Also, the red and gray branding on the card makes it a bit easier to spot the card in case you drop it or leave it somewhere. I\\'ve had nothing but success with SanDisk MicroSD Cards. Although you may pay a few bucks more than the generic brand, you don\\'t want to trust your pictures or video recording to anything else.As such I only buy Sandisk MicroSD Cards.. Keep up the good quality! Works very well in my smartphone. Great speed. Highly recommended. I use it successfully in my Samsung Galaxy SII phone. Exactly what it looks like. 64 GB micro SD card. reads and writes well. Comes in good packaging with an SD card adapter. SanDisk brings a high quality product and I tend to stick with them over some other cheaper brands. I don\\'t want to write a review for each of the 8, 16, 32, and 64 GB SanDisk MicroSDHC Class 10 Cards. They\\'re all 5 stars. They\\'re extremely fast, and as Class 10s, have allowed my Canon SX50\\'s shutter to speed up because it transfers information so quickly with the camera\\'s very small processor. They also allow a burst mode of 9-13 fps which is amazing for a non-DSLR.These cards are also very reliable. I\\'ve had no read/write failures in the two years that I\\'ve been using them.The one &#34;negative&#34; is that they\\'re so small and can be dropped easily when getting them out of the adapter. Still, if you\\'ve been working with computers since there was a gerbil running the power for your PC, you have to marvel at how anything this small can hold more than 30,000 high def 6 GB photos on a 64 GB card that is smaller than your pinky nail. Not much to say about this other than it works fine.  The included adapter was difficult to remove the microSDHC card from, but that may be due to my big fingers (plus the card is very small as one would expect from micro naming).  The speed is more than adequate with no buffering issues noticed from video capture on a phone at HD(720) resolution.  Recommended. If your electronic calls for this size, you have to use it. But I hate it.  It`s too darn small to fool with. This one works well, but I will try to avoid this size in the futher. I use Sandisk exclusively for serious pro-sumer work including 4 hour concert videos. I\\'ve never had a problem in 3 years and wouldn\\'t use anything else. I bought this to stash all (the ones I would watch on the go) the movies and songs that I previously owned to my new Galaxy S4. I am extremely impressed with how fast the device works outside of the phone and inside when used by the phone. It is dramatically slow when the phone with the sd card in it is wired up to the computer via usb, but that is really unrelated and the process isnt painstaking. Fast and huge in capacity, definitely a must for enthusiasts.NOTE: As of ICS, Android has stopped allowing the movement of apps into the sd card. So if youre planning on installing games onto the card, you will need to have a rooted phone. The card is very useful for other things (music and video, and ROMS if youre interested) even then. Transfers at about 10MB/s, not super speedy but it allows me to run software from it on my windows tablet. Great Great Deal!!!! I bought this for a Really good price ($25) after i bought my Brand New Galaxy S4. I looked in stores and found the same Micro SD card selling for $60-80. This works straight out of the box and I have had no issues at all with it. Buy it Now! It works great I\\'m using it for my car dash cam and I purchased 3 different cards and this is the only one that was actually fast enough for it to read and write. Wow! Fast memory card. I bought this for my new GoPro Hero 3. Great performance for full HD video.Shipping was fast, and nice communication on shipping and estimated arrival time.The SD Card adaptor works perfect in my full sized SD reader built in my laptop.Transfer speeds were blazing and read speeds are amazing.SanDisk is the best, really worth buy the top end class 10 micro SD card.If you doing HD video this is the card for you. Video is demanding, so youneed a SD Card that can keep up.In Hawaii we play hard, and the GoPro and SanDisk card have been working flawless at full 1080p60 video. We needed an option to increase the storage available in my wife\\'s Nook Tablet and this serve the purpose perfectly. Just inserted it into the Micro SD slot and seconds later it was recognized. So far this card has worked well. No glitches or dropouts. It is recognized by everything so far; work computer, home computer, camera. Not a problem yet. Gets stuck sometimes in the adapter and is a little hard to pull out. But other than that is a great product I have no issues with this card. It works great and now I have a ton of storage space for music and what not. Bit overkill, but that\\'s how I like it. After I ordered my GoPro Hero 3 Black  I started searching for a good MicroSD card and everywhere I looked they wanted like $80for a 64GB  and digging around on eBay get\\'s retarded at times  then by chance I found this one for $55 TTD  and the performance is awesomeI tell you all if you are in the market for a GoPro Hero3 Black  get this card to go with it  you wont be sorry.... Using this with my mini MP3 player and plinking songs onto it worked flawlessly.  Now my 4gb player is a 20gb player. I used it with my Gopro and it recorded amazing 1080p videos and long time lapses. No issues with freezing or corrupting HD videos. I used this on my dashcam that records 720p continuous for 12 hours without fail. Also used this on my Zoom H1. I use this with my GoPro 3+ Black. It works well. It\\'d be nice if it came with a little USB 3.0 reader like some other brands. It is a memory card. It works and gets the job done. Hasn\\'t failed on me yet *knock on wood* sandisk is  the best and I trust them cause the take care of the quality and the packing was great Works exactly as it should.  No issues in the Samsung Galaxy s5.  Have not noticed any speed issues as well and I use it plenty for movies. I wish I could install one of these in my head.  But I will have to settle for installing it in my brain.  The increased memory for my tablet has been great allowing me to use it for many things. Got this for my Dell Venue Pro 8 tablet - works well - very fast at least for the tablet, of which the memory is more this speed than true SSD) and SanDisk gives you good quality for a reasonable price. Goes on sale often here on Amazon - so look for a deal. Don\\'t even waste your time buying this memory card. 64GB is written on it but its actually even less than 3GB that\\'s in it.i have never experienced such deception.i had tried loading my pics and music and other data on it from day one but no matter what i did i won\\'t take more than 3GB of data. i didn\\'t realise till i read other stories of similar memory cards that will state 64GB but would contain a smaller memory capacity often times even less than 10GB.i bought this card for $49.what a big waste!!now i am so scared of buying memory cards on amazon or online elsewhere.i wouldn\\'t dear it again!it was in a sealed  sanddisk packet so i was thinking it must be original.Alas!it was a big  waste!i have lost confidence in buying memory card on amazon. I took advantage of an irresistible offer from Amazon, and this 32GB card performed like charm in my Roku.I\\'m very satisfied and suggest to anyone looking for fast micro cards give a look to this one. I bought this to put into a wifi enabled USB flash drive. It works fine. I can get my entire CD collection on it, which was my goal. Fast and safe very good quality and has an excellent performaceA bit expensive comparing to other models in the store Can\\'t comment on reading speeds, but my flac audio files run smoothly on Sansa. Sandisk have never failed, in other cards so I assume this will hold up to that, if not, I\\'ll update. Does what is suppose to do. Good price. The delivery and shipong was fast. This isy third piece. I use it for my dash- car cameras. excellent product, very fast and lots of space.. I am using at Samsung galaxy S3, there are no issues, ..recommended.. Bought this for my wife to be able to record tv programs on her phone so she can hand it over to the baby while in the car and starts to get fussy.  This thing holds a lot.  The phone takes a little longer to start up since it has to open up all her media but not by much.  Great! I purchased this micro memory card for my GPS. When I updated the maps recently, the GPS ran out of room and I could no longer put the entire US map in it. This card fits neatly into the GPS slot, and adds enough memory for the GPS to work. I haven\\'t had this fix in place for long, so don\\'t know about how well it will continue to work. The adapter looks to be handy if I have another use for the card. Got this yesterday, the 64GB item. Installed it in my new Samsung Tab3 and turned it on. the Tab3 saw it right away, and I decided to format it,,, only took a couple of seconds and I was good to go. It shows that I have 59,000 memory units available, they must use the rest for overhead I guess. I haven\\'t used it yet, but I am sure it will work fine. If I have any problems I will note here,,, also if I have great praise for it I will note that also. At $34.99 I guess it was a good price as I see it is now $46.00, maybe I shoulda ordered two of them. This is my first time for a lap top, and I will be on a big learning curve. I got the lap top at Costco last week,,,,,,,, I sure hope a old dog can learn new tricks..... I use this primarily to store music and photos on my SD card. The camera writes to the card directly and I notice no difference in speed. I haven\\'t had any formatting issues. First thing I did when I popped this into my phone was format it using the built-in option under &#34;Settings.&#34; It has worked flawlessly for over a month. Really good deal, definitely a good way to save money  buying an item with less memory and buying one of these is a lot cheaper I bought one for my GoPro last year and ended up putting it in my tablet last week. Ordered another one for the GoPro. After the trip next week it will go in my phone. Guess I\\'ll need another one for the next trip. Got a Transformer Infinity Tablet (32 GB) which was a decent amount to begin with; However I wanted a microSD to double it to have a decent storage size. I decided to go with SanDisk since I\\'ve never gotten any bad portable storage from them before.MicroSD is still working fine in my tablet. Has my videos I wanna watch on the go when I have my tablet. Also useful to store and apps to for installation. This is just what my S4 wanted! I have so many songs to take around with me that I had to get a bigger card and this one is great! No memory issues any time soon! Adds extra storage to my phone flawlessly. The UHS1 means its really fast speed too. Highly recommend to get one of these for any phone/tablet that can take one! Pros:small,compact32 gbHCcons:none so farThis unit does what any micro sd card should do and does it quickly.  I bought this for my son\\'s android tablet for memory extension and he can run apps directly from the sd card with no problems. The micro card is excellent for its intended purpose. I bought several and have had no problems with them. That I don\\'t like having to deal with cards of this size has absolutely no bearing on its performance or its rating. (I have never used them with their adapters and so cannot comment.) I saw the difference between this and another of 4gb that came with my digital camera, it\\'s really faster than the other.Now I\\'m using it in my smartphone without any problems so far. Purchased for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, and worked fine. Pretty fast and nice amount of storage. SanDisk is a good brand. Holds lots of video memory. Small, compact and convenience for travel. Due to the small size need to remember where you place it. Where else can you get legitimate micro sdhc 32 GB memory cards for this price. The speed is 30 MB/s. Fast low cost 32 GB. Cannot go wrong. Name brand. San disk. I got ripped off buying imitation unpackaged memory cards that only worked days. Used in GoPro as other user reviews indicated the 32 and 64 GB cards did not work well.  Just buy more of them, I recorded over 1000 photos and 60 minutes of video on each 16GB card. I can\\'t complain. The memory card does its job. I recieved the memory card very quickly and I have not had any issues with the card as of yet. What can I say - its a memory card. It remembers what its supposed to. At least it remembers as well or better than I do.Only problem I have with these Micro SD cards is - they\\'re so small they\\'re easy to lose. If these things get any smaller we will start inhaling them by accident when we sneeze or something. Still going strong after a few months on my HTC phone. Did get disconnected a few times though, not sure if its due to the card or the phone. Hopefully it can last :) I only buy thru Amazon I\\'ve tried eBay and you always come thru and I got messed over four times and no real recourse you just lose and PayPal is nobodies pal. And these no more rack are terrible and all these others take my advise stick with the one that has always came thru every time for me. Amazon and only Amazon . H.Rhodes only works with cameras having a remote screw. Works well with Fuji X2. Red even makes it just fine but would like black. does what is was designed This is a nice storage device, works well and comes with a standard size sd card adapter. Worth purchasing.Austin I got this to use in my GoPro Hero 3+ and it fit and worked well. Since that camera did not come with a micro SD i was forced to find one and i choose this one because it was the cheapest i could find at the time. This made me a little weary of the product but after receiving and using it i have no complaints. It stores and preview the pictures/videos to the highest resolution and HD quality i had to preview them on. I looked at the pictures and videos on my 60 inch TV and it was like watching HD TV. It works fine in my phone.  The phone detected errors when first used and I was worried, but I let the phone reformat it and all is good.  Excellent for the price.Beware it may not work in older devices. Comore esta memorka para completar mi nueva samsunb galaxy tab y funciono muy bien...ahora tengo 48 gb de memoria para alamcenar info. I use it on my SAMSUNG GALAXY S3, it works great... more space to save all my documents, pictures and more :) Get just about you want in it, plenty of space to keep your best shots and memories.  It\\'s the best and the price is very reasonable. This is necessary because you need space storage in your phone, and with this microsd card i have 64GB its perfect This card is fast, works really well with my S3 and prepare to last. The app is good not the best but it gives you the option to back up your phone use it on my phone and have some apps installed don it and the speed is great, havent had any issues with the brand before and noe still today!!! This is just great. but the damned thing is really small. I had one before but I put it down and lost it for good. I have two of these, one for each of our smartphones and they work great. Ultras far surpass the basic microSDs The SanDisk Ultra 32 Gb microSDHC memory card is a good value for the money.  It doubles the memory of my new Samsung Galaxy S3 and there is no perceptible delay between access to the card and built-in memory. Class 10 SD cards are certified for certain high demanding applications like cameras. We use a pair of these in our HTC One cell phones, and have had fantastic luck with them. Works great in my Note II. No issues. Reads and writes fast. No corrupted files and my Note II had no issues reading this card. My friend bought an off brand card because it was cheaper and every so often he gets a &#34;card not found&#34; error. Good buy. I got the 64gb card in and i just placed it in the sony cyber tx66 camera and and it ran it\\'s preparation program for 2 seconds, and low and behold, it works perfectly. after shooting and taking hd movie and highest res pictures i used sony software download and it recognized the card at about 59.8GB. this camera could probably take the 128 micro card I bought the 32gb version here for my Samsung Proclaim android phone (Straight Talk Wireless model). Removed my current 4gb card from the phone, put it in one card reader in my Mac, then put the new 32gb card in another card reader in my Mac, copied all phone files over to the new card (saving the old 4gb as a backup for now). (Note: I did not have to do any formatting of the new card to read it on the Mac or in the phone.) Inserted 32gb in my phone, booted it up and have had no problems in first hour of use. Will update if I notice overheating, card failure, etc. as reported by a few others here. I\\'m showing about 29.3 gb of available storage on the card as received from Amazon (before copying my files to it). the best quality there is in memories is super fast, wonderful and cantiad of gigas is very good, the best brand and speed I bought this for use in my new GoPro Hero3 black and it works great. I like the fact that it comes with an adapter, though I really wish that we\\'d move to USB adapters as the standard \"accessory\". Highly recommend. i have this in  my go pro hero 3 black.  works good hold a ton of videos and pics.  fair price after shopping around thanks prime!  this is the maximum the go pro can take so have at it! Works Great with my Note 2.  Had no problems installing it and I didn\\'t have to format or anything.  I put it in, turned the phone back on and everything transferred over quickly.Thanks! Using it in my LG smartphone and they recommended this speed memory card.  So I ordered it and it booted and went into service with no problem.  No reason to think I will have a problem. Can\\'t beat the price. I ordered this in a frustration free for, I don\\'t really know why, and to my surprise the package was already open.Amazon is trying to make my life so much easier that I won\\'t even need to open anything anymore. /ironyMaybe someone messed with my card, maybe not, but I\\'m never ordering anything in frustration free package.I\\'ll test the card and update the review.Update:After testing the card and contacting Sandisk about it, i\\'m able to confirm that the card is authentic.The 3 star review reflect the packaging. I might not use it next time. got the easy to open package the card worked first time, the Samsung pad recognized it, these cards are a bit expensive though. Works, was priced right, has adaptor.Now I have to fill in more words to meet the minimum requirement. e I\\'m finding more and more electronics are using micro SD cards.So I\\'m stocking up. Good buy for the price. I use these for cell phone and other devices requiring a MicroSD Card.  This one is compatible with all my devices, even the ones that are &#34;outmoded&#34; like my cell phone.  Works great.  No problems storing or reading data, ever.  I consistently use SanDisk for my cameras, music devices, etc. Highly recommended. I have always been satisfied with sandisk products this memory card did not disappoint with it\\'s fast reading and writing ability Sandisk has done it again. So, I was looking for a card to put all of my music on for those occasions when I have my phone but don\\'t have my HD Zune -- which by the way is the BEST music player EVER and it\\'s just a low-down shame they don\\'t make them any more -- and this card holds all my tunes with about 4GB to spare. Excellent speed for music playback, excellent capacity.  Would be nice to get it in 128GB, but the price of those is simply not reasonable. Product is as expected.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.1 x64 (C) 2007-2010 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World : [...]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read :  32.903 MB/sSequential Write :  10.263 MB/sRandom Read 512KB :  31.584 MB/sRandom Write 512KB :  5.485 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) :  3.296 MB/s [  804.8 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  0.894 MB/s [  218.1 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  3.002 MB/s [  732.9 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  0.617 MB/s [  150.7 IOPS]Test : 1000 MB [F: 0.0% (0.0/29.7 GB)] (x5)Date : 2012/12/12 17:12:51OS : Windows 7 Home Premium Edition SP1 [6.1 Build 7601] (x64) The number 1 thing that\\'s important about a product is that it works and works well, and this card does.Before purchasing, make sure your phone or camera supports this card. I\\'m currently using this with the Galaxy S3 and it\\'s been working flawlessly. So far I have only used 16gigs of the sd card and the S3 phone loads everything in a couple of seconds every time I have restarted the phone.Just because the card is class 10 does not mean it will make your device faster. The device being used has to be capable of supporting the card for them to work together harmoniously.Also, some devices (like the Galaxy S3) do not require the card to be formatted and it can be used straight out of the box. With a 59 gig capacity (as the rest is reserved for the card software) I do not have to worry about running out of space anytime soon as I was with my previous 8 gig card. Transfer files easily and very fast. Sandisk makes great SD card and they are very reliable. I am very pleased with this product. I\\'ve requested a replacement, so I\\'ll update this review after I receive a replacement.  But the first card I got, it could be read, but every time I put it into the computer, it said there were errors with it.  It couldn\\'t repair the errors.  I couldn\\'t even format it using a command prompt to try and get it to work.  I could create folders on the card, but not put anything into them or onto the card other than folders.  I tried many many things and nothing worked.  I know SanDisk makes decent products, so I will change the review later. Works like a dream with my S3 smartphone, used for camera pics storage, videos and music; really enhances the capability and flexibility of any device with the slot. Hard for my Mac to read. MHz be Mac, might be card. It\\'s fast in a gopro, no real complaints Fast access time AMAZING amount of storage in such a small size.And the price was impressive,could not beat it!Thanks Amazon! I\\'ve been using this card on my Venue Pro 8 without any issues.  I used primarily to store photos and videos. The card is reliable but not fast.  Data transfers on Windows range from 15 to 20MB/s.  That speed is sufficient for most purposes.  I got my card at $32 which is s good deal.  A faster card can easily double this price. These are fantastic for laptops and tablets. I put all my music onto two cards and have all my music with me when I travel. Not too much to say about the card, other than it works well in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  The price was great for such large storage and I believe you will be very happy with your purchase. The SD card adapter came in handy and we were able to use the card in my father-in-law\\'s Nikon D3200. I bought one but it died on my galaxy s4 but i sent it in to sand disk and they sent a brand new one. Bought 2 of these absolutely no issues This card does exactly what it should.  Class-10 performance at a fair price in a MicroSD format.  It should be faster though, and in fact there are options out there now at a nominally higher price that do, including the &#34;extreme&#34; versions from the same vendor. Its amazing the amount of storage we are putting in micro chips these days.  I use this for my dive camera taking videos and pictures.  The chip hasn\\'t let me down yet and no errors. awesome! Worked well with the Surface 2 tablet.I later return the Surface 2 tablet , since it didn\\'t seem like that I needed it but I made sure to take out the memory card :)Never had any issues with it though when I had it. I use this in my Samsung Galaxy S5 to store my photos, videos, and other data. Stores and retrieves quickly and greatly expands the capacity of my phone. this is probably the Nth memory card I\\'ve bought from sandisk, and so far I\\'m still very happy. r/w speeds are decent and none have given me any troubles. The item arrive in time, but was unfortunately defective as it would not accept a copy operation. Further investigation led to discovering the card had bad sectors. Refund is progressing without a hitch however, so not all was lost. Works great on my Galaxy S3.  I have not had any issues with it in about a year of ownership. The only thing better doesn\\'t exist yet, just be sure to get the U1 marked model as others are slower bins. Works Ultra great. No complaints. I got the retail package. My computer couldn\\'t tell the difference, or at least not noticeable to me. I needed the extra space. Thanks for having a great product with a great price! I trust these.  Got it long ago and it is still going strong.  Any large size storage needs to be reliable, If I buy the one or two gig cards I would just get the cheapest no name brand but for anything larger I get these. Can\\'t go wrong with Sandisk! Always works. Never any issues. And this one is no different. More than enough storage space I have been looking for a 64GB memory card and I found one at our local electronics store but it was over $100.  I logged onto Amazon.com and found this at a great price.  Why pay more when you can come to Amazon and get it for less. First of all Amazon has shipped the mobile version of this card. It is different that what was listed on the page. There goes a star for incorrect shipping. And the item has stopped working after a week in my Surface tablet. This product works as advertised.  The 64 GB card allows you to store Video and stills without having to change cards between uses.  I love it. As described, no problems. Recommend it.Only problem, price is too high. ...I may order the 64 GB as well. This product works fast and is very reliable. The capacity is huge. I use it in my tablet and in my phone and can carry lots of pictures and videos. Highly recommended. After buying the SanDisk Ultra no other card speeds will do.  Whether watching videos, playing music or transferring files over ftp, this card handles it very well. I purchased new Samsung Galaxy S4 phones for my wife and me. We wanted to be able to take pictures and family event videos without constantly worrying about not having space on the phones. The cameras on the Galaxy S4 are wonderful, but that means bigger files too. These &#34;SanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card&#34; are fast and we have not even begun to fill them up. I use this with my Samsung Galaxy Player 4.2. Never had any issues, product works as described. I\\'ve been using it for almost a year and have almost used up all the space on it. I\\'ve never used the adapter with anything so I can\\'t comment on that. I remember when I built computers that had 5\\' x 3\\' 2GB hard drives; and by now most have Googled to learn of the room sized computers with basketball sized transistors.Micro computer; how long before our entire life will fit on something smaller than the point of a needle . . .?This SDXC disk has worked well with my Nokia Lumia Windows 8 phone. My wife has one in her Android phone and with kids taking pictures and making movies 64GB is starting to look like to little an amount of storage. Tha memory card works great, i havent had any problem with it, i recommend it for a gopro H3 camera SanDisk is all I use. These are the backup microSDXCs for my two pro Canon cameras. They always work, never had one fail, and will store thousands of JPEGS on this card. I shoot in RAW on my CF card but simultaneously have a JPEG backup onto this card. I\\'ve never filled one even though I shoot thousands of photos on photo shoots. It\\'s a 128GB microSD card, so there isn\\'t much to say about it.  Make sure you check that the device you\\'d like to use this with can handle this much space.  It comes with an SD adapter, so if you have an SD port on your computer you can use it there.  Happily have this plugged into my Galaxy S5.Pros:- Lots of space- Durable little buggerCons:- Price per GB ratio is bad (but considering the tech this is probably as good as it\\'ll get for a while) I bid on a 64 gb micro SDXC on ebay which never worked to start out with and realized it too late to return.  The multiple issues I had with my newly purchased Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 was caused by the inferior memory card.  All the problems with the tablet disappeared once this memory card was inserted.  Lesson learned, any technology accessories should be purchased from a reputable retailer like Amazon to ensure quality of product. works well with my hero3 black gopro.its not on the approved micro SD HC card list from gopro, but it should. works great and low cost - cant beat it. Huge Video Card. Use it to back-up my netbook computer without a CD/DVD unit. Watch out for fakes. Make sure this is an authentic SanDisk card, There are fakes out there. There\\'s a program that lets you verify yours is an auththentic card. The fake ones are really tiny drives made to look like a 64GB card. This one is authentic. this did not last very long. Would not work in any of my mobile devices. I tried it in 4 different ones and the only place it now works is in my desktop in the adapter sleeve. Not much use there, since i already have 2 TB This MicroSDXC fits great in my Surface Pro tablet and provides all the storage I might need for now and can be replaced with another one if my business vs personal storage need grows too large but 64 GB is plenty of space. The Class 10 is also fast and smooth. My camera required it, the brand has a good history, my experience with the brand over years has been very good, the price was ok, buying via Amazon is the easiest, least aerobic way to go.  I\\'ve not found cards much cheaper from other brands and personally like to stick with those with which I have good experience. I was a bit concerned when I first ordered this microSD card.  Samsung\\'s documentation says it is compatible with an SDHC card, but this one is SDXC.  I read a bunch on Google about incompatibilities, but they were older forum discussions.  I read the SDXC used to be incompatible, but that Samsung published an update late last year that allowed the Galaxy Note 10.1 to work with this card without the need for reformatting to a FAT file system.  For the price, I thought I didn\\'t have much to lose and would give this a shot.My report:  The Galaxy Note 10.1 read the card perfectly when installed.  There was a small glitch where the Note asked to format the card after I removed it from the tablet and transferred about 25GB of data to the card (from my PC while it was in a card reader).  All I needed to do was to remove the card again, and reinsert and reboot the tablet, and the problem went away.  Have been using this for hours doing extensive read/writes to the card with no failures.  Will update if I have any issues, but for now, I am extremely pleased with the performance on this. This is a great up grade for me. I use it for my tablet and it gives me lots of extra storage. I would recommend to anyone. Works exactly like it is supposed to. I can\\'t wait however for a 128 GB card to come out and blow this out of the water. I am very pleased with this memory card, I use it in a dash cam in my car. The quality of videos turn out great and I have no compatibility issues with any equipment I may use for playback. Excellent speed and of course storage. No problem whatever with my HTC M8. Insert card, point music, photos, and apps to the SD. I see no issues at all. Nice Item and I have ordered several for my smartphone, tablets and so far they work great so if you need more space order never had any problems with memory from san disk.  quality good products.  buy again for future needs.  good for a long time It works great in a 7&#34; Andoid tablet.  May switch it to my GoPro for the additional memory.  I will have to see if it downloads fast enought However, SanDisk replaced it and didn\\'t charge for shipping.  So I guess I\\'ll wait and see how long this one lasts. These days, who doesn\\'t need plenty of storage to move your apps, photos and other stuff to keep your phone running smoothly? Great price with no chance running out if space for a long time. I use it in my Samsung Galaxy 3 cell phone and it works great.  Good value and quality. I highly recommend it. Fast as it gets. Even in my phone this thing rocks! In a camera you can almost slow down time itself. I wanted to believe that those people who wrote bad reviews on memory cards were just unlucky. Well it sucks being one of them. I cannot get this card to format not matter what device, software or technique I use. The mistake I made was that I didn\\'t use the card right away to see if it was good -I thought, its a memory card, what could go wrong. Now I\\'m out of the US and returning it is not economically sensible. I don\\'t know if it\\'s quality control, but this card simply cannot work in any reader, device, with or without adapter (write protection off on the reader of course). The card shows up on devices, may even show data being copied then when you refresh, nothing has happened. All formatting software says it\\'s write protected and nothing I do can remove it. Why would a new card come write protected anyway?  Very disappointing, especially since I lost data from my phone. I forgot I had I a SD card in my device. It\\'s a seamless part without hesitation. Micros are hard to remove but that is a device flaw Puchased this card right after I received my Samsung Galaxy S III. Truly found this to be quicker than any other class 10 card I\\'ve owned. The cost on Amazon was far less than I\\'ve seen anywhere else. If \"you\\'re\" looking for this type of product, then this is the one for you...IMHO of course. I use SanDisk Ultra SDHC cards for photo and video and have always been satisfied. When it came to needing a MicroSDHC for a GoPro, I purchased this card. It provides the same reliability, consistency and workflow as the larger SDHC cards and with the included adapter, it easily installs in my current SDHC card reader. It also means I can use it as a back up for my SDHC cards, should the need arise, giving an extra 32 GB as a spare card. Good card at a good price. Put this in my Samsung Active phone, works great.  My first chip started acting up so I needed to put in a new memory card.  Works just as fast as the on board memory, loads photos, videos, music really fast. This is a really small card, but it holds the data and does the job.  It comes with an adapter allowing the card to be used in a laptop or card reader.  It has worked well for me so far and has my recommendation. This is one of the better reviewed SDHC Class 10 cards that utilized UHS. By reading the reviews you will see that it reads/writes at a better speed than many or most cards out there right now. Much depends on your phone, how your phone\\'s OS stores information on a card and what\\'s inside your device. For MOST of us; you probably will not notice anything different between this card and any other GOOD quality card out there. I usually pick the fastest cards on the market when the prices drop. The main problem, speed related is when you transfer large amounts of data (usually music) onto any card. If you use a standard USB 2 connection this card won\\'t speed that process up. If you use a USB 3 or if you actually put this card into a USB 3 reader to do the transfer; then you\\'ll see a nice boost. If your device requires a card that the product can UTILIZE and has the OS and chipset to take advantage of this FAST card; it\\'s a no brainer. If your device is older, if you just like storing music; then you can find a cheaper good quality card. If you find this at a good price no matter what you have... BUY IT After a long research about the SD cards. I came across this deal. I wanted an SD card for my new Samsung Note 3. None of the review was talking about Note 3. Most of the reviews were either about note 2 or S4.A few reviews were talking about possible problem of not able to recognize the card and getting into the cycle where you have to call SanDisk. I was not sure to go for it or not. Although choices were very thin. Samsung cards were way out of my budget.So I decided to take a chance and I am happy that I did.It\\'s working smoothly. No need to format. Just works great. One star for not exactly 64 GB. It shows up 59GB.I will again update this post after 1 month. When I will really sure it has no problem I bought this for my wife\\'s tablet computer.  It has worked perfectly so for and I have no reason to believe it won\\'t continue that way. SanDisk makes very good products.  I\\'ve used their products for many years and nothing has ever failed - high performance, fair pricing and great reliability. These are genuine Sandisk memory cards, but from a defective batch.  I lost all of my photos and videos taken on my phone over the last two years because the card had a catastrophic failure.  SanDisk reps informed me the batch was bad and they were aware of the problem. Lighting fast card and very well priced. came with backup software that allows your phone to be backed up to either a cloud service or to the sd card. I am really pleased with all SamDisk flash drives I\\'ve had and this is no different.  It went in my sons mobile and nothing but good things to say...like it should be SanDisk Ultra Class 10 micro SDHC card (16GB, 32GB, and 64GB)I purchased the 32GB card for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and the 16GB card for another video recording device. I formatted both cards in FAT32 using Windows 7, and functioned without drama in the respective devices. I purchased the 64GB for my GoPro Hero3 Silver edition.The reason I chose the SanDisk Ultra is for the Class 10 speed rating, as well as the waterproof, shockproof, vibration proof, and X-ray proof durability. I had the 32GB Sandisk fail after 2 months of easy usage in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I don\\'t abuse my phone and it is not subject to extreme temperature/vibrations. Sandisk replaced it under warranty but it was quite a hassle to do this.The 16GB card however, has been subject to extreme temperatures for well over 4 months: from -5F to 100F and that doesn\\'t include solar loading from sitting under the sun, as well as 100% humidity! The 16GB card was dripping with water after I experienced water intrusion in one of my cameras, and it had been soaked in water (while operating) for several months.The packaging was easy to open by simply cutting across the top. However, finagling out the blister pack took some patience. The Frustration Free packaging is essentially a cardboard envelope sleeve with a plastic holder and the SD card adapter with microSD card inside. This is how it is shipped!Overall: 4/5 stars. Very affordable and decently fast micro SD cards. These are perfect for smartphones or recording devices used in extreme environments. However, one of them failed within 2 months. The speeds are also inconsistent. I posted a benchmark photo on Amazon showing my speeds with all 3 sizes of cards and the 32GB was the fastest.UPDATE 28 OCT 2012My 32GB card has failed after just over 2 months of use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It started dismounting/remounting intermittently by itself over night. I woke up this morning to find that the card is not readable via the phone and wouldn\\'t work on my PC. The phone has not been abused and was not used in an extreme environment. This card was replaced under warranty by Sandisk. I bought 3 when they were on sale but I did buy 1 prior to the sell. I use it in my go pro and it works great. (I can\\'t compare to others tho because this is the only memory card I\\'ve used before) Works well for the Galaxy S3 and provides additional space for pictures and music. It was exactly what I expected it to be. Popped this into my Nvidia shield for extra storage. It was recognized instantly and was easy to transfer files over.I haven\\'t had it for too long to comment about failures in some of the reviews, but will update accordingly. So far recommended! Comes with adaptor and case so it\\'ll work well as a regular sd card or micro sd. Works great! Affordable price. I am primarily using this to supplement storage on my Microsoft Surface Pro and have a small library of movies and TV shows to carry around while I\\'m on the go. A lot of ultrabooks and the like come with just 128gb of storage and I think this SD card is a great way to store some media while you save room on the hard-drive for your program installations etc. The speeds I\\'m seeing are consistently around the peak that the card is rated for, and work great for playback of my lossless MKV movie files recorded at a high blu-ray quality bitrate. I\\'ve also tried it with my Android smartphone and I\\'m seeing similarly high peak-performance speeds for file transfer and smooth playback of media. It comes with an adapter to convert it to the standard SD card size in use with devices like SLR cameras etc. so you\\'ll be covered under almost any circumstance. I only wish I could buy a larger capacity model, but as it stands I think with the Amazon sale prices that regularly come for this product it\\'s a great deal. Card is well constructed and delivers the wright speeds that it promises. Works great in my Nokia Lumina 822 running WP8. This was a great little memory card for using with my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet.  I\\'m able to have my music with me at all times, plus a large number of photos.One item to note: this type of memory card may not be suitable for high speed applications (such as with a camera or for storing virtual hard drive type information).  These micro cards are a 5 star if used for their intended purpose. This was a great deal and now I have plenty of storage space for my phone.I can store my ringtones, hundreds of songs and at least 6 movies.This is also the  new micro-SDXC Card which is designed for high speed transfer. Works well no problems with SanDisk products. Always a good risk to use this brand of card. Price was right and shipping was fast. I bought this card and it worked OK, at first. After about three weeks I noticed that some images were not showing up, a week later it began to loose everything. My Note 2 was failing to recognize it, inserted into the adapter and my comp could see it but not read all the files. Multiple formats by either the comp or Note 2 did not fix the problem, even tried some tools that I used for my DSLR, still no-go.This could just be a batch problem as the card looks legit and was fast in the beginning. Installed as sublimental memory for Samsung Tab 3 8 inch tablet.  Doesn\\'t look like apps can be installed on the card, but that is a Tab 3 issue, not a San Disk issue.  Something to think about when chosing your tablet.  I plan on installing a lot of memory hogging field guide apps, so theTab 3\\'s 16 GB built in memory may be a problem for me.  On the other hand, I have a lot of music, so the SD card will be useful. It came on time, with the adapter. I installed it on my Samsung Galaxy 5. Works great!Scanning 32 GB takes a little more time than the 8 GB I had before - it is expected - nothing to \\'complain\\' about.I would recommend it to anyone interested. I got this memory card for my daughter\\'s Samsung compact camera so she could store and save many pics which it holds thousands. 8 gb card works fine in the device, but this 32 gb card will unmount when moving or copying large amounts of data.Never tried reformatting or in-depth troubleshooting, but I expect products from a reputable company like SanDisk to just work. I have seen and purchased these at lower prices so I was disappointed on the cost but I needed them pretty quickly and I knew Sandisc\\'s are good SD cards. Nothing beats class 10 SDHC, I would highly recommendfor anyone that requires memory, especially for this low price. There is nothing better. I use this card to back up some of the files, that I have on my work computer (at home).  and be able to use them on my laptop computer I ordered it for my phone to store more music and pictures.  When I first installed it my phone kept resetting until I removed it, cleaned the contacts, and reinstalled it. Everything has been fine since. Bought this to use in a ContourROAM video camera. It was the Deal of the Day, meaning a special discounted price. Also came with hassle-free packaging. Never a worry with SanDisk memory. Awesome deal. I needed a micro SD card with more storage for my phone.  This was a good price for a lot of space. Great buy, works fine - very happy with it. I bought this for my gopro Hero 3, it works good it stores about 4 hours of high resolution 1440. The best to go. I got a note 2 and needed more memory  well this is the one to get. I have had no problems with it. Recommended I have a program that allows me to condense the movies I own into about 1GB size. I transferred them to this card and am able to watch movies on my Samsung tablet. I also have music and home movies on there. When my husband had surgery recently and waited for hours in the waiting room. I watched funny movies and family movies. It took my mind off things and the time sped by. got for my Cell Phone and this card works nice and fast on my cell phone as well as on my pc to load it. Very confident with this brand, never failed me ever since.  Placed it to my E72, performed great.  Looking forward to long years of using this chip. forget loading this into your cart.  a one day pause and this junk went up 16.99, in ONE DAY.  I don\\'t give money to aXXholes. I didn\\'t  even have this card installed in my Motorola  Razor HD for 6 months when I turned my phone on yesterday and got a message stating I removed my card before properly unmounting it first even though it was still installed. I plugged it into my PC adapter and nothing! I lost about 300 documents and over 500 pictures, but i\\'m glad that I just backed up everything 2 weeks ago. Worked great until it died far to soon and without any warning at all. Be sure to backup all your important data frequently! The SanDisk Ultra is a very high quality micro sd card. I have bought several and have never had an issue with any of them, which I can\\'t say about less expensive cards. If you need a card for your smart phone or tablet, this is it, just make sure not to get a bigger capacity card than your device can use. The first one had some sort of problem, and would stop responding to the phone or stop playing music, a reboot often fixed it for a period of time, but inevitably it would stop again.  Amazon replaced the unit quickly and the replacement works perfectly (I am so glad it wasn\\'t my phone!).  I have almost 10,000 songs on my phone now, who needs a separate music player.  It would easily handle video, photos or a monster app collection as well, it\\'s great taking a modest capacity phone and making it bigger than anyone else offers stock, for far less than you can buy the phone with the extra capacity. Perfect for my Galaxy Note 2 and the price is very good. This memory card does not stall or you do not have to wait for it to load like other cards do. Sandisk has the name but in my experience the quality and speed is not there. My lexar lasted longer and outperformed this chip. There really isn\\'t anything bad you can say about a well performing Micro SDHC. It gives me good speeds and works fine in my devices. There may be a bit of confusion given its look but this is an SDHC Micro SD in case anybody was confused or wondering. 32GB is the official max of SDHC devices so be careful if you see 64GB SDs. Love this card, its fast and sports an insane 128gb of storage. Amazon had a killer price on it too, well below the big box stores. Works perfect with my phone and my HD video recorder. We bought 2 of these 1 from best buy and one from amazon and the amazon is still running the best buy craped out after 6 months im currently using it for my nokia lumia 810 and my camera, works very well and very fast! but expensiveEdit: I was really happy with the card until I had to record video on it. It seems that it doesnt write fast and my recordings end up being choppy and unwatchable. I was really disappointed in it, cuz I had to switch back to my phone\\'s storage when recording video. Be careful with buying micro cards out there.! There\\'s a ton of phonies out there but this one is the real deal and you just can\\'t go wrong with the sandisk brand name and it was for a very reasonable price too.! I purchased this memory card to expand the storage on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. After installation my Note 2 recognized the card and I\\'ve been using it to store images and music without any issues. I didn\\'t run any metric software on this chip as some others have done, but I can tell you it\\'s a pretty spicey little guy.  Everything I store on it via my ASUS TF300T is accessible faster than any other chip I\\'ve tried.  Some videos that \"stuttered\" using other chips are fluid with this one. This might be my 3rd 32 GB disk that I buy from scanDisk.They work for few months and then NOTHING...My tablet wont detect them anymore... my computer wouldn\\'t either.Quite disappointing. My wife loved it and me too because she take all the pictures and movies that want make and I don\\'t need all the time ti pick out from the tablete. Got this for my Samsung NOTE 2 - best investment ever!!  Plenty of room now!  Not a lot of lag time and does have almost the full 64 gbs available. Currently using it for my Samsung Galaxy S3. It\\'s very fast when transferring files in and out. No complaints so far. i have a Samsung Galaxy S3 phone and the microSD works great with my phone, it gives me the memory that i need to store videos and photos instead  of using the memory from my phone Seems like a good alternative to flash drive. Cost per gig seems like a pretty good deal, very convenient to carry around. I put my reading, music, pictures and videos on separate cards. Much more portable. Unfortunately smart phones and tablets are lagging. I bought this for my girfriend and she is happy with it, she is not very data demanding as I am, I bought the 64 bit Extreme model.It works fine, not even needed to format it. Good pair of micro sd card that i bought for my m4/3 camera and phone. Have been using it with my Olympus OMD ME5 camera for a while and before that a Sony Nex 5N and my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. No issues so far and the price is just right. Works GREAT on the Dell Venue 11 Pro tablet. I now have double the space.  Can store over 50 full length movies. I bought these microSDXC cards for use in my tablet, however, my tablet only recognizes FAT32 formatted cards and not the exFAT that these cards use. I had suspicions about this based upon other reviewers\\' experiences. Windows computers will not reformat in FAT32 beyond the 32 GB limit. I was able to locate a small program that would reformat a drive to FAT32 without the 32GB limitation (FAT32 can accommodate up to a 3 TB drive). I used the Windows GUI version of fat32format (freeware) and it quickly reformatted the memory card. Now the card works in my tablet. Ordered it on 1/10/13, never received the first 2 sup[posed shipments then 32 days later an envelope arrives with a counterfeit SD card that was detected as fake with H2TESTW software after writing only 71mb\\'s it crashed several times. No hologram or individual serial number on the Chinese knock off packaging either. Make sure you know where they are coming from! Only buy these from reputable authorized dealers! It\\'s worth the extra couple bucks to avoid this frustration! Got this to go with my little E-Prance dash cam.  Had to reformat it to work with camera, but works fine now.  Cost half as much as camera. I formatted it when I got it, put it in my device and it has worked fine.  Videos played on my tablet from it play fine and its write speed seems okay to me. i always buy sandisk because of their reputation, they make a great product and have never had any problems with these sd cards. I am very happy with this SanDisk, if anyone is looking for a goodly amount of storage, get this one. I purchased this card to work with my gopro and I have no complaints. I does not lag on 1080p 60fps or when I do a 10 photo burst. Great product and an even better price Its just an SD card. works as good as any other. I don\\'t know what else to say about it. I purchased this to increase the memory of my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.  Just placed it into the slot, was instantly recognized and thus saving my internal memory and increasing the memory of my device. Price was the best, I went to several sites and price closest was $98.  Shipped through my prime and got it in 2 days.  I have seen no issues with this card and am very happy with the purchase. I ordered this for my son and he loves it. More memory space than the one I have of 32. I plan on getting another one for me because I love to download a lot of videos, music, and take pictures Purchased two of these in total. One to hold the music for my mp3 player and one to hold the music for my smart phone. Both work well. Easy to load. No problems encountered. They serve my intended purposes well. Arrived quickly and in good condition. Pleased with purchase. 16gb is a good amount for what I use it for and SanDisk is #1 fir sd cards, I\\'m satisfied. very fast and reliable, couldnt ask for a better product from a better company. unless you have a electronics lab in your home i dont think you could possible come up with such a beast. I purchased this memory card to use to expand the memory of my new Surface RT tablet. This memory card appealed to me first because I have always liked SanDisk products. Second, the price you this particular 64 GB card is a steal. The memory card includes both an adapter for the PC and a clear plastic case. Though I\\'ve only been using this card for a few weeks, I purchased a similar card earlier this year to use in my smartphone, and so far so good. I highly recommend this item if you need to expand the storage on your tablet. FAST data transfer! This is the standard, the measuring stick for a great 32 GB micro SD card- you will not regret getting the brand name instead of getting the cheapos. I bought this to add more storage to a Sharper Image action (Go Pro knock-off) camera, and it fits the bill perfectly. The camera came with a generic 4gb card, but this 32gb Class 10 card provides much smoother playback. A nice deal for just under $17. So far so good works as described and on my LG Motion 4g android smartphone.  Speed is pretty good too even though it reverts back to class 10 on this phone. A month and a half after purchase...  My device powered off while the card was in use (batteries ran out).  Since then, doesn\\'t work.  The device doesn\\'t recognize it.  Doesn\\'t respond to recovery, reformatting, partitioning... nothing.  I\\'ve used EaseUS, ZAR, HP USB Disk Format, and a couple others.  No dice.  Nothing can read it or fix it. This is a wonderful product.  I have over 100 movies on my phone not including audio.  And I still have 30gb left.  This is absolutely wonderful. I added the memory card to my Galaxy S4 so that it can hold lots of music, videos, and have room to grow.  I mistakenly thought that it would allow me to store additional applications, but I was mistaken. I wanted a fast 64 GB microSD card for my Evo LTE and this one fit the bill.  I grabbed it on sale and it\\'s worked great without any issues.Speed benchmarks fall into the proper range for a class 10. This ultra micro-sd card is faster than the standard micro-sd cards. However the adapter provided with the card is not good. Data Transfer was quicker when used with a different adapter than the one provided with the micro-sd card Only 29.7gb of usable storage.Arrived 20th of June, no problems so far.Crystal disk mark:SEQRead 19.1, Write 9.3512KRead 19.2, Write 0.74KRead 3.5,  Write 1.2 Bought from BestBuy online the day it was announced. I have tested in my Sony Xperia Z Ultra and my 12inch Samsung Pro tablet.Both work fine. Shows 119GB available. Only issue I have is that I paid 199.99 for it :(Best Buy will most likely match this though. I recommend anybody to get the 64gb Scandisk Ultra from Amazon, if you are looking to expand your tablet or any device memory. This product was delivered on-time with simple to open packaging. Inserted into my Windows 8 tablet and was able to save, edit, and so on with no problem. I just added about 35% more space to my windows surface pro with this little gem. (64Gb).  It worked seamlessly. I love this card and it is super fast. Great for putting it in a tablet to keep it from slowing up. And it was $15 reg $70 gives me something to brag about too. Large storage, perfect for tablets (using it on Asus T100, after maxing out 64GB very quickly), but maybe too slow comparing to SSD, as it\\'s the first memory of this kind to reach the microSD format, that\\'s an acceptable tradeoff. Bought this to download more songs and music from spotify for my phone. Totally worth having the extra space since spotify won\\'t save songs to your phones internal storage. Has a fast response time.Your going to need to buy one of these eventually since smart phones are advancing and so are the tablets coming out.Slided it write into my phone and worked like a charm on the first try.Pictures and apps load really fast with no lag time.Love it so much im going for the 64gb and always class 10 for me.1 less thing to worry about. I\\'m using this with my Samsung Galaxy S3 to expand the built-in 16 GB memory. My modest music collection uses about 10 GB, so I needed this micro SDHC card for a little more breathing room. I went with 32 GB which should last me for the life of the phone. I\\'ve been using it for a month with no problems. If your phone supports micro SDHC memory expansion, this is the one for you to get. Received two today and they have \"Made in China\" imprinted on them.  Although they were detected and formatted fine to capacity in both Samsung phone and tablet, lets see if they hold up and not suffer premature death like many have reported.  Thinking I should\\'ve gone with \"Made in Korea\" Samsung SD cards instead if they had 64GB size.Update: Bought two 12/2012 and one year later with very light use one of the cards started locking up the phone with \"wait or close\" prompt when deleting files off of it.  Should\\'ve gone with Made in South Korea Samsung card.  Sandisk is garbage these days. I\\'ve used one of those cards in my phone for about 2 years now and never had a single problem. Recently bought another for my tablet and so far so good. Recommended very small size and huge capacity.Just what I was expecting to my cell phone.Also, I can use the adapter to download the information directly to my computer. My T100 Transformer read the card immediately. Nice and compact storage solution. Does the job and you won\\'t be disappointed. I bought this for my GoPro and so far it\\'s worked without problems (the gopro runs out of batteries before I can fill this up). This is fantastic, its fast and bundle of space.I have been using this for 2 years already and still going strong. I store all my pictures and video on here taken by my phones.This is a must buy for your phone! Got this for my son gopro and it works perfect he is able to record and take still video and pictures and the quality on playback is very good. a would recommend and buy this product again. Great card. Works with my gopro and Canon 1D Great value. Fast shipping. Brand you can trust.My previous card by &#34;another manufacturer&#34; died after only 3 months of use, along with everything on it.For 64 GB, this card is a beast of a value. I\\'ve dropped my phone hard several times and had no data lost from this card. It\\'s fantastic.My primary use is recording 1080p video and high rez pictures to the device, as well as audio recordings. I use this for media.  It\\'s fast transfer speed allows it to keep up with all my demands. Only time will tell how truly reliable/durable it turns out to be. I\\'m going on 2 months now as of January 2014. Any adversities I have along the way, I will post here in updates.Smashing good value of a card!TIP: When you first get your card, be sure to use your phone (or other device you\\'ll be using it in) to format it. This is standard practice with all card based memory, and will prevent you from encountering errors or oddities with your device. This card is of excellent quality and it does exactly what it should do.I use SanDisk almost exclusively and I\\'ve never been let down by one yet. This is the third card I\\'ve ordered and I will buy a fourth when needed. The frustration free packaging is amazing! It\\'s an envelope that has a pull-tab. Can\\'t get any simpler than that! The card itself is a class 10+ and I have not had any issues with any of the ones I\\'ve bought. This one went to my brother to upgrade the storage on his phone. Does all it should without any notable negatives. What more could I ask?I would buy more as I need memory. Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  Has not blipped once. Movies, music, etc. Do not hesitate to buy this. dont even bother to try - will not show up in finder and will not show up if placed on any reader I got this for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 (p6800) and it worked great for about 3 weeks - September 18 through today, October 7.  It just died while I had the tablet attached to my PC and was copying another file onto it, so I\\'ve changed my rating from 5 stars to just 1 star.  I\\'d give 0 stars if I could.  Another user warned me that this had happened to him after 4 1/2 months, but 3 weeks?!?!?!?!?  I\\'ve reported this to Amazon and asked for a refund.Stay as far away from this card as you can, at least for the Galaxy Tab 7.7.UPDATE:  Amazon refunded my money for this card, and I replaced it with the Samsung equivalent, which is STILL working perfectly.  Don\\'t waste your time and money on this card - get the Samsung. Good product that is working well, was packaged well and delivered as promised. It was a birthday gift for my sons laptop Bought this for my ASUS TF700T Transformer tablet. No issues whatsoever. GREAT having 64GB internal plu, now, an additional 64GB in SD. after 4 months it stopped working i got a new one form SanDisk but I\\'m very apprehensive to put it on my phone. I\\'ve used the 32GB version of this card since I got it in two Android phones and no problems with either phone.  It gives me all the music, pictures, downloads, etc. storage I\\'ll ever need.  As fast as any other card and faster than most.  I also love Amazon frustration fee packaging.  Since there are so many fakes with online retailers, buy from a trusted source like Amazon. This memory card works on my Motorola Droid RAZR M! Even though my phone\\'s &#34;information guide&#34; says it is only compatible with a 32GB memory card.  Once formatted, it works great.  So worth not spending the extra money just to get a phone with a ton of built in internal memory. A truly great value, not nearly as expensive as I thought it would be. Lots of memory and good speed as well. Excellent brand, as good as any of the other cards I\\'ve ever used. Highly recommended for any appropriate uses. I like all of the San Disk products. And it got stuck in the adapter they sent with it, had to break that open.  It fit in another adapter though This is one of those basic items that usually just work. In my case, I received one that just did not work. A couple of weeks ago, my phone reported an error and so I reformatted the card and transferred my music back onto it. Unfortunately it failed again two days ago and it won\\'t even format now. I have had good luck with SanDisk before, but this one was not a good experience. I love this card. It is fast...... and enough space to hold more than I will use. I can put movies on there with plenty of space for music, pictures, ect. Pros: 32 GBs more for my tablet. Works great.Cons: None to speak ofOverall: I hold this and I feel like I\\'m going to lose it. It is the perfect size to add storage to my tablet, though, and that is what I want it for. What else can I say? It is SanDisk memory card, which I use almost exclusively because I have never had a problem with any SanDisk product I have owned. Consistent high quality products that work as advertised. This is a 32gb memory card. Works right out of the case, Does exactly what the description says. Very fast Read/Write speeds. I recommend this to anyone (I am currently using this on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 I bought it to expand the memory on a cheap Android tablet. It is recognized and works fine. No problems. I bought this memory card to be used in my GoPro Hero3 Black.  I couldn\\'t believe how small the card is!  SanDisk isn\\'t kidding when they say &#34;Micro&#34;.  I\\'ve taken photos and videos all over California and its worked without issue.  Definitely worth the investment! I purchased this card based on the price.  After I ordered it I finally started reading some of the reviews and started getting worried about whether the card was going to work.  Seems that a lot of people have been having problems getting the phone to recognize the card and then, if needed, formatting the card.When the card arrived I put it in my phone and it immediately was recognized by my android system (JB 4.1.1).  I had already copied all the music, pics and video off my older, slower and smaller card onto my computer so all I had to do was plug the phone into the computer, open the card and copy everything into it.  Everything went in with no problem.  I then unplugged it from the computer and tested my videos and music on the phone and everything worked like a charm.Bottom line, I did not have to format the card, I just plugged it into the phone, it was immediately recognized and worked like a charm.I would highly recommend this card based on the price and the product that you are receiving. I just don\\'t get what has happened to SanDisk quality.  It seems to have gone down over the years.  This product was glitchy from day one.  I thought it would be fine after a quick check disk, but then it only got worse.  After less than a week I have to return it.  What upsets me is that this is not my first bad experience with SanDisk products.  I used to buy them all the time, they were my brand of choice for flash memory (cards or thumb drives).  The last three products I have bought from them have had problems and failed either immediately or shortly after usage.  So I give up.  I will start looking to other companies for my memory needs.  I bought a Transcend to replace this.  I hope it works out better. I love SanDisk storage and got this for my tablet\\'s MicroSD slot -- it works flawlessly and doubled my tablet\\'s storage with no fuss. The performance has been snappy enough for my needs and I can copy things into and off of it very easily. Since ASUS tablets are known to slow down if their main storage gets too full, this is really useful for giving me a place to offload things to, like apps that I don\\'t want to download again but want to keep on hand, media files, my ebook collection, more music, etc. This is a terrific memory card! I use it with my go pro to capture 1080 video and its got ALOT of space! SanDisk makes some of the best SD and Micro SD cards out there. This one is no exception :) :) What\\'s to say?  It\\'s fast and I have had no errors from it.  I mostly use it to hold music so I can use my phone as an MP3 player. I purchased this product to install in my Garmin GPS unit, since it was full and couldn\\'t handle the new map updates. Easily and securely installed, this memory card promises to provide a long life to my GPS unit. Quick speeds and a ton of memory.If you have an expandable slot, get this.It was nice being able to store all my photos, videos, and music on my phone finally. The supplied card with the R8 is 2GB, that only holds about 6 songs.  I had to keep deleting projects to make room for new ones.  Solution: Get a larger capacity card.  It also makes selecting, saving, and deleting projects faster.  No problems after 1 month of use. This went into my Raspberry Pi, and it works great. I have had nothing but success from this little guy. Also, it conveniently came with the SD adapter. Had no issues. The card and adapter worked as promised, and not all sad cards bought on Internet do. Good luck No issues in my little cell phones. works as advertised, priced well, no issues. not much more to say, but Amazon requires few more words ;) I should have known better. Everyone is complaining about this memory card if you read reviews on specialized forums. Last time I buy anything from Sandisk. I can always count on a good bargain on Amazon. Not only is the price good but their Prime program has saved me big time... Broke after  2 weeks.....I will go back to Samsung HD cards... This was a waste of time and money. Actually, I should ask for a refund Great write speed and lots of space! I bought this for my Galaxy S3 and formatted to Fat32 and it works great! SanDisk is the only brand I use - I probably should have gotten a 64 gb as well; but prices keep falling, so I can\\'t really lose. I have zero complaints, this card does exactly what it should. I\\'m amazed by how inexpensive memory cards continue to get. These things are really useful to throw on your keychain because they\\'re so small.Update: From 5 stars to 1. Dead after 4 months. Appears to be a fairly common issue: [...] Let\\'s see how the RMA process goes.... The Memory SanDisk Ultra 64GB Micro-SDXC Class 10 UHS it has been working really good and it is fast at loading my content i would really recommend this product to anyone that needs a memory card for their phones, tablets and more. i don\\'t get the class 10 stuff but the higher the number the better from what I have reseached.  I have it for my smart phone and works fine. While updating maps for my Nuvi 40 I received a message stating I needed more memory to download new versions of maps that I required.This was probably a bit of overkill, but the price was right, so I ordered one. Two days later, I installed it and it worked flawlessly with mucho memory left for future needs. Will be buying a few more of them for other uses, can\\'t go wrong with this card!!!See ya\\' Great transfer speeds for my Tablet. Going on a month now and it works just fine. Highly recommend it to anyne. I have both the Samsung Skyrocket and Note 2 Android phones and this card works great.  Mine came formatted for exFat.  Android will need it formatted in Fat 32.  To do this use the format function built into the phone.  After the format it works great! If you are looking for a good SD card look no further. I use this in my Samsung Player and it works great. You can pop it in and out of multiple players if you want to give you flexibility. Also priced very good compared to other places. I bought this for my wife\\'s new SmartPhone, so that she should never run out of space for photographs, or at least it will take her a very long time ;-)  We\\'ll see how long filling it takes once she gets going ;-) When purchasing a memory expansion for my electronic devices I typically purchase from SanDisk.  It is a trusted name and does what I need when I need to do it, like feeding the chickens or mowing the lawn, Sony and Ultra can\\'t do that.... This is the cat\\'s meow.  And the best song from stage play &#34;Cats&#34; was &#34;Memories&#34;.  If you keep forgetting things, get more memory.  Just  remember to format it in your device before use.  (I think I forgot to format my  brain before use.) Large capacity, fast and functional.  San disk continues to provide the quality the public has come to expect.  I have never owned or had any problems with their storage line. Like many here, mine failed and I lost my data (but being smart, I had a backup).  After further investigation, I found this product is NOT compatible with Android and a number of devices (cameras, phones, gps unit).  Windows seems to love it though.  Wish I had a windows device that could use 32G... my only one uses a whopping 100k at best.  What a Waste.UPDATE: Reformated is as FAT32 and works ok in my android devices and my Sony camera for about 3 months now.  Still, I keep a hot quick backup (OTA) every day to my desktop computer... I\\'ll just say I\\'m not 100% confident in it yet. Ultra quick. You can take several pictures in sequence and this memory keeps it pace. Even at movies it shows its speed. I purchased a couple of these for use with a new digital camera that also shoots 1080p video. This is a great product for that purpose. Fast transfers and I have had no hiccups in writing to the card. I got this for my brand new Nokia Lumia 810, but there is some kind of problem, the card is horribly slow, I can\\'t record HD video to it, it studders.  I\\'ve tried reformatting several times to no avail.  I didn\\'t have any of these problems with my old 32gb class 4 sandisk card...  There are other people having this problem as well, seems hit or miss.  I can\\'t recommend this card at this time for this reason.EDIT:  I\\'ve contacted SanDisk and they are RMAing the card.  I\\'ll improve the rating if the new card corrects the problem.EDIT: Got the new card, problem still exists...EDIT: I\\'ve suffered with this card for a year now, the only problem is that I cannot take video without studders, so I figured maybe software updates would eventually fix the problem.  They have not.  I have used multiple different camera apps, and the problem still persists. Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  Fast and dependable, no problem with viewing videos from it on the Note 10.1.  Try it you will like it! Amazing price for this micro SD.  Brings adapter with it.  Class 10.  Great product. I am very happy with this purchase. I got this for my new GoPro Hero3 Black edition and it has worked without a hitch.  Even in the highest setting I get over 2 hours of recording time, and the price per Gb was extremely reasonable. My phone makes very high definition photos which makes a big size file. I do not transfer the files to the computer because I have plenty of space. Also it works faster than ever. when i got it it was broken so i had to send it back... they sent me a new one immediately. i am so happy  cause my phone\\'s internal capacity is 2 gigs... that\\'s not much... -_- I purchased this card on a daily lighting deal for my new Samsung Galaxy Note II. It was recognized without issues. I connected it with its adapter to my computer\\'s card reader to transfer about 3Gb of data and the best consistent transfer rate (average) was roughly 13Mbps... That\\'s less than %50 of the advertised transfer rate.To be fair, I\\'ve used the same external card reader with my Sony HX100 digital camera with an SD card (16Gb class 10) and I get double the transfer rate of what I\\'ve gotten for this card.Here is the setup:1- SD Adapter included with this card.2- External 12-in-1 USB 2.0 card reader connected to a USB 2.0 port on my PC3- Files transferred were of varying sizes.4- Transferred from 2TB Seagate X2 SATA3 HDD (connected to SATA2 port)5- Windows 8 Enterprise x64 (oh yah baby)The only excuse I give this card for its bad performance is the files were relatively small sizes but some of them were as large as 50Mb... This still does not justify the very low transfer rate.I am not really picky because this card will reside inside my super phone but still it does not justify the money paid for this card.I hope this will help others. Major issues, bought FROM san disk but only worked briefly, now when I try to reformat it reports itself as a 30 meg removeable drive in both windows and macos--not sure if its defective or a mislabeled one--but got direct from amazon so just very disapointed. Will stick with transcend from now on I think. Comes with a lifetime warranty.  Had one fail once, sent it back to SanDisk, they sent me a new one!I have been using SanDisk for years.  That was the only time one ever failed!!! I using this micro sd on my Sony Xperia Z, It\\'s running fast and has a lot of space, now I can store all my data on this card What is there to be said it\\'s storing data on my phone. I just got a Sony Experia Z1 and it has such a quick response time I can\\'t even notice. When transferring large zip packs it may take 30 seconds for about a 1GB I needed some new SD cards for my new tablets. After researching I bought the SanDisk ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10. It is way better than the almost same price SanDisk Ultra without Class10!! The Ultra Class10 is lightning fast. you can see the difference when you copy large files, you will note that read and write procedures are much faster, whether you use it in camera, smart phone or tablet. The price is also ok. Only drawback I noted was that the recognized capacity is not 32GB but 29,71GB in my Asus Memo Pad. Other than that I am extremly pleased with this Micro SD. I am rating this product with 4 Stars, simply because I have yet to learn if my Samsung Galaxy Note II (purchased on 11/03/12) is causing &#34;defective&#34; and &#34;reformat&#34; messages to ocassionally appear on screen or this SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A is culprit. However, I have yet to &#34;loose anything&#34; stored on this card. Otherwise, if the messages did not appear and/or I learn for sure it is a phone problem, I would rate this card with 5 Stars. I\\'m so happy that upgradable memory exists.  I get to listen to a plethora of podcasts, music, and instructional MP3s.  Thank you SanDisk! using card in a Sony action cam,  records perfect, very happy with card and adapter.  no problems.  reads and writes good When your item arrives on time, in perfect condition and the price is good, what more can you say? This works great and no troubles. I have both a PAD and a phone. With one of these in each I can take the card out and read it directly on my computer. also if I wnat to load some pictures or movies, I just put them on the card and put it back in the PAD or phone. I don\\'t need to subscribe to looney tunes or whatever they call it. I can just put on or take off what I want without a third party being involved. Very nice indeed. Bought two of these for me and my daughters Samsung Galaxy S3, and they store so much on them. I love my phone even more. There is not much to review other than how it works - so far it has been just as hoped.  The read/write time is very fast, and I have had no issues.  I am currently using in a camera and it give basically unlimited pics and video due to the size so is great when travelling. 16GB Kingston - class 4 - micro SD (Amazon \\'#1 Best Seller\\') = 4:30 @ about 5 MB/s16GB SanDisk Ultra - class 10 - micro SD = 2:15 @ about 10MB/sResults from my informal data transfer test. Copied a large 1.3GB video file to my two micro SD cards.This SanDisk Ultra takes about half the time to transfer data. Time is money and I\\'m happy with the results considering the current Amazon price is about $11 vs $14 for the SanDisk Ultra. I bought this to add additional storage for my MP3 player.  I now have a ton of music and audio books on my MP3 player. It will take awhile to listen to all of it! Good for the price and so far it is working just fine on my phone.  Finally I can now save pics taken from the camera and things I download. Will review, when I install and use. Product arrived on time. Appears  to be quality and what I need. Will review soon. It functions...it\\'s a memory card, not sure what else to post. It works great and I haven\\'t had any issues. Great price too. AS ADVERTISED. 64GB HIGH TRANSFER SPEEDS AND oh yeah ANDROID FTW 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Pro:  Small, fast, and priced OK.  This is basically a class 10 card; file access is noticeably faster than a class 4 I was using before.Con:  not really noticed anything. Can\\'t beat the price and quality for the capacity. I always buy these chips from Amazon. SanDisk chips have worked well for me. No problems with read/right, no lost data. The product met my expectations (I expected it would go in my S3.) That\\'s about all there is to say. I originally bought this for my digital SLR and it works the way it is supposed to. Since I didn\\'t need capacity for over 7,000 pictures I put this in my Samsung tablet and got a 32 gb for the camera. If you need or just want 64 gb of memory this is the one to buy. No problem with getting card to fit, works fine, love extra storage. Recommend to anyone. 64GB plenty for file storage The memory card was exactly what I was looking for. It came on time, in fact it came early. Now I have upgraded the memory for my tablet and can download movies to take with me any time I need to. Really the gold standard.  I will reserve 5 stars until they blow me away on the price.  Otherwise, this is an excellent buy. After purchasing several SDHC from other sources I was almost ready to give up.  Each of those was somehow defective.  The Amazon SDHC is genuine and works like a charm. Not a steal at $62 but anything under $1 per GB is a decent price for high end SanDisk Class 10 memory. The real value was in being assured of authentic SanDisk product and a very fast delivery. I would buy again from this seller.  The 64GB microSD installed, reformatted to NSFS with no issues, and performs as advertised. Both of these items arrived on time and tested out at 9.8MB/s write and 19.8 MB/s read using H2Testw.exe.(500 MB file size). I would have given them 5 stars if the write-speed was just a bit faster. I bought this to increase the storage in my smartphone.The Samsung Note came with 16GB, with about 12GB usable.Installed this to store movies for long trips.Holds about 10 full length compressed mp4 movies. Very nice addition to a Xperia Z tablet expanding the storage area up to 64 Gigs. Easily seen by OS of my Tablet. Fits micro slots Well worth the money high storage/ cheap and fast enough for a phone sure you can  get faster cards but you really don\\'t need it Very fast and does the job. I have placed this inside of my LG Optima Pro and it works great. The price is right. I was not interested in this because of its small size, flash and now with 64 became excited to use. This is perfect!  I picked this up on Amazon for $25, and I could not be happier!I\\'ve used this on various devices such as Surface RT, camcorder, laptop and it works without any problems! I never faced any issues ...so far..so good. It works well with my tablet. It is super fast and reliable. Bought it fit in my new Galaxy S5. Nothing more to write. its a great product and price was good and it works. Bought this to use in my Galaxy Note 3.  Two months later, works just like is should.  Amazon has the best price available, (and much better price than the offer at Best Buy). Es un producto que recomiendo ampliamente solo se instala en el telefono este lo formatea y listo esta en fincion para ser utilizado al 100% No brainer. This is not the regular 32 micro sd its the HIGH CAPACITY ULTRA...just go price this baby anywhere else and you\\'ll see that AMAZON is the only place you should even think about buying this little powerhouse from. No brainer. I started to have trouble with my card after about 3 months. I shall attempt to get a replacement and hopefully the new one lasts much longer. Works as expected. Love the great price and use it with my GoPro3. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. I used this card to reply a Class 4 on my Fujfiilm X20 and the writing speed is much better now. Before, after shooting a picture in RAW format, highest quality, it took 8 blinks on the LED for the image to be written, with this card the time is 5 blinks. This is a substantial increment in speed. Very satisfied with the product and price.SanDisk has not let me down never and 32 Gb added to my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet just rocks.I could have gone for the 64 Gb but I really don\\'t need more than 32. And the price was right SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card one of the best memory card I bought, how quickly and read the data back is amazing I bought this as soon as I heard that Amazon and Best Buy were the only retailers carrying it (for the time being).It arrived promptly and worked with my Galaxy Note II flawlessly. I have been recommending purchasing these to customers at the store I work at regularly to try and get more people aware of the benefits of mass storage on small devices. I ordered a San Disk Ultra 32 GB and received it the next day via Prime. The only problem was that the card was defective. I went thru the process to return, which was simple, and did so. Received an email that a replacement had been sent with one day delivery. Got it today .Card is good, everything is perfect.I THANK YOU Not too much to say about it other than it\\'s a class 10 card for a cheep price. I\\'ve had for about a month and it works perfectly. My old card was the basic black HC and failed after about a year and a half. came in fast and managed to get it at a gold box discount, seven more words are required? thats cool i guess. Having a 32gb mirosd is great! I use it in my phone and hardly have to upload my pics and what not. My phone works faster with all the extra space and I never have to worry about needing to delete any songs,pics,or apps. I use this memory card in my Galaxy S3, and though I had some issues getting it formatted correctly (this is the phone\\'s fault) it works like a dream and have had ZERO issues. On time, so much memory!!!!!!  I used my 32GB on a week vacation and didnt even fill it up.  I\\'ll use this one next, but my 32GB is the same brand, class and speed. after doing some tests between a generic memory card and this sandisk i am very disappointed. i bought the 32 gig class (10) card.i swore i picked \"original packaging\" but it was shipped with out original packaging... i will be returning this card for the following reasons:these tests were done using the sd card ports on my pc.my generic class (6) 32 gig card has upload speed of 22MB (write) and a transfer speed of 8.5.my sandisk i just bought, it has an upload speed peaking at 32MB (write) and a transfer speed of 6.5 to maybe 8.5 if im lucky.the write speed is ok, but why is the transfer speed so much more low. why isnt it at least 10MB if not 12MB if sandisk is typically so modest in their classifications?and whats the deal with the no classification marking on this sd card... i dont see class (10) anywhere on this card....amazon you will be getting this back! First, it kept unmounting on the Galaxy Note 10.1I got it replaced.I used the replacement on my Galaxy S4 and it heats up my phone when charging. IT GETS VERY HOT. GS4 does not get hot with other sd cards. awaiting my second replacement. Class 10 has a cost... I am wondering today how we did manage with 500MB cards when a few minutes of shooting a 1080p video do take so much space... I calculated that I could be able to record no more than about 5 hours of 1080p movies with this 64GB micro SD...On the other hand, the micro card itself is so tiny!... About the size of one of my nails. Miniaturization has gone a long way...In any case, I did put this into my GoPro 3 Camera and it recognized and formatted it immediately. No issue at all... This is a big card for a great price.  I remember buying a 2GB CF card for around $200 a while ago! Bought it while it was one sale for $35.... I love itIt has given my Surface some wiggle room.Don\\'t expect the read and write speed to be super fast. Most likely you computer doesn\\'t support the current protocol to transfer at the Max speed.Overall Quality you expect from SanDisk though I think the price of this can come down bit more, now that the market is slowly moving away from microSD expansion aside from Samsung Using it with action cameras and they work just fine with no issues.  Tend to be getting around 2hrs when filming at 1080p @30fps for the 16gb card I use this with my Contour ROAM on the race track, hasn\\'t failed me yet. I would buy this again. Works very good. I love this. This is a memory card that will be used for my wife\\'s tablet. This will upgrade her memory to the maximum. She will have no storage space problems. Purchased this card for use with my new SLR camera as a backup.  Read/Write to the card is fast which allows maximum use of special modes available with the camera. Data transfer speeds to a computer are also good, no real complaints.  Overall a good SD card for the price. The chip worked fine, fit perfectly, but it is SO TINY, if it falls out you are going to have a hard time finding it.If your application is a Tablet, or pad, if it has a &#34;push-in&#34; holder...you will want to put some tape, or other securing agent across the top of the chip and onto the Table sides.  If I had thought of it, clear finger nail polish would have worked just fine, or even a half drop of super glue on the top.I didn\\'t, and it\\'s forever gone now.  I changed from Android to Ipad and very satisfied that I upgraded to Apple. Piece of crap died two months after I bought itI am sure that makes it on me to buy anotherGREAT! Working flawlessly as it is supposed to.  I like the speed of the product.  The adapter case is also nice to have. this is my 3rd sandisk micro sd card for my 3rd android device, and just like its predecessors, the Ultra 64gb micro SDXC class 10 worked flawlessly in my SCH-I605 Samsung Galaxy Note 2.i simply inserted the card, power-cycled the device, and once rebooted, the Note 2 recognized an unformatted sd card and asked if i would like for it to be formatted in order to be read. once i chose YES, i now had an additional, fully usable micro sd card that i use for media and ebook reading storage.the response time is excellent, so i have no complaints on performance.i also love the fact that i ordered this at 3pm on Thanksgiving day when i was alerted of the $39.99 price tag. Arrived on time and did everything as expected.More then enough cap to hold severail hours of recording_____ _______ Used it in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it was ruined within a month.  Second one I went through on that phone.  Contacted Verizon, Samsung, SanDisk, Google, and read a lot of forums.  Turns out a lot of people were having the issue with that phone and these cards.Of course the girlfriend threw away the card so I couldn\\'t return it, so I don\\'t know if the issue was fixed or if was a bad batch of cards that went out or what.  It\\'s been a few months and I haven\\'t seen the problem as much as before, so I can only assume it was a bad batch.I\\'ve had another card in my phone for a while and haven\\'t had any issues, so for now I can\\'t recommend this specific card unless their issue has been addressed. Local storage is still a necessity (or a really nice-to-have) in this cloud-connected world.These cards (with and without the SD adapter) have been used in my mobile phones, DSLRs, computers (Lenovo Y500 and MS Surface Pro), tablets (Asus Transformer TF700, Nook HD+) and have been rock-solid.  I own 4 of them and in my DSLR they\\'ve proven to be fast enough for burst shooting and high-def video.In my mobile/tablet/PCs, they\\'ve been used to shuttle HD videos and other content back and forth without a hitch.Still love local storage and these cards are a relatively cheap and reliable way to achieve that. This thing works great. I have it to store pictures and videos and it works perfectly. I put it in and it formatted, and after that, no hassle at all. It was the best priced microsd here on Amazon and I am happy with the purchase. I would buy again if I needed to. plugged it into my Surface 2 and doubled my storage capacity.  i have had no problems with it. It is fast enough to use for videos. Good price and working well. I used it for my Galaxy S3, S4, Note2 and Asus tf700, also purchased one for spare. Highly recommended. was able to increase storage on my Surface RT. No more carrying around an external hdd. Holds enough of my music library. Added additional storage on my Surface Tablet.  It allows me the storage of items that I want or need to transport to other devices. I bought this to change my nook to android and boot off it. It\\'s fast and reliable for daily use. Formated to FAT32 using Easy Partition Home Edition (free on the web) and it works on both my Samsung Galaxy S ii phone and Asus TF101 tabletAm gonna buy another one so each can have one I would recommend this item to anyone looking to upgrade to a 64gb memory card whether for your phone or camera. I have read many places that this would not work on Android tablets, but have found that the card requires you to format in a Windows computer to get it to work.  Even tablets that are rated to 32GB have been found to read / write this card to 64GB.  You need to download a free partitioning program, and format using that to FAT32.  First erase the current partition, then repartition to 64GB, then format.  You can\\'t simply use Windows to format to FAT32 on newer Windows computers, and even on older Vista, the max it will allow is 32GB at FAT32.  Using the partitioning software bypasses that 32GB limit and formats the whole card so that when you after insert into tablet reads something like 59.4GB formatted space.  Huge capacity for the money, and a FAST card.  Search internet for formatting 64GB microSD card for Android and read up on it. Ain\\'t technology amazing?  I got this card for my mom when we bought her a new smart phone.  I wanted her to have plenty of room for pictures, music and some movies. Perfect.  Took card put old 32gb card and transferred it over to it in the computer.  (while my Samsung galaxy s5 was off).  Then inserted it in my Samsung galaxy s5, powered up and it was like I had never took the 32gb card out.  Read ringtones, programs stored on external sd card, everything - no errors, no glitches.  Connected the phone to the computer via usb cable and (usb 3 slot) and in no time my 75gb of music was transferred to my phone and it all read and is working perfectly.  I could not be more pleased when a products works like it is supposed to. 32GB Card takes my smartphone to a new level.  Recently purchased a RazrM and this huge capacity card allows me to take tons of picture even with a good percentage of my MP3 collection and about 9 movies on MP4.  Fast and so far so good as far as data integrity.  Highly recommend I packed everything that I wanted to use on my tablet onto this card and only took up about 25gb, but I haven\\'t seen any delays in response times, whatsoever. It\\'s very comforting to know that I have a massive amount of storage space available for downloads, pictures, videos, etc. Thank you to the manufacturer and seller for such an exceptional product and price. installed this big baby in my S4 lay night and it is rocking and a rolling did first test think I got 26mb read which I am plenty happy with I was moving things onto the card also I think so not sure how much faster it can go computer I am sure it will be faster The card was good.  Haven\\'t had a problem with it yet.  Good price.  Fit the product I bought it for. I already had a SanDisk 16GB Class 4 card in my Android phone. Here is how you know this is faster: I\\'d press the Play button for the music player with the Class 4 and there was always a small delay before the music played. With this 32GB SanDisk Ultra, the music plays immediately. This is a very useful way to tell how fast this is. This memory card gets my Approval and my Thanks to SanDisk! Great price and great quality. It fit perfectly in my device. I highly recommend this brand. The adapter was a nice bonus. fast and easy to use.  It does exactly what a class 10 is supposed to do.  using in a Samsung tab 3. does exactly what you would expect, use this in my new galaxy tab and not disappointing as always a great product I\\'ve had this memory card for about 4 days. I ordered it with my new Galaxy S4 Verizon. Worked perfectly out of the box, didn\\'t have to format, and read & write speeds meets up to my expectations. I will still keep my eyes on this card for little longer because I see some reviews reporting that cards fail after some time, but seems to be ok for me.Not relevant to this product, but I did get ONTRAC shipping(Amazon prime 2 day shipping) for this memory card and my Galaxy S4. After reading SO many negative reviews and feedback about this shipping company, I was crossing my fingers and hoping that they wouldn\\'t do something stupid to my package. Fortunately, I got my package on time and nothing was damaged. One minor complain is that ONTRAC does not update their tracking history very often, or at all(based on my other purchases). As I was phoneless for couple days and really needed a phone, I checked the tracking history probably once every couple hours. It was showing that it has left the faculty for 2 1/2 days and was not updated at all until about an hour before I got my package saying that it went out for delivery on 9AM (I received my package around 5PM). Again, I got my package on time with no problem so I\\'m ok, but with the history of ONTRAC being so rubbish it just made me worry because I didn\\'t wanted to be phoneless for 2-3 weeks. Compatibility should not be an issue with these memory cards.  Even though they are SDHC they are very backwards compatible.  I threw a 32 gb in my phone for extra storage and I  have had no issues with it.  Make sure you move apps from your phone to your SD Card storage though.  It\\'s future proof and you can hide important files on it if you want. Simply Put: It is a 32 GB MicroSDHC card that came in the mail when it said it would, it was empty when I got it, it works as expected (it holds files, images, etc.), and it has the adapter included. Voila. I bought this card because I hope to transition from a PC to a smartphone in the near future. For now I use an adapter to run it on the PC. The write times aren\\'t as good as I had hoped, but they\\'re acceptable overall. Plenty of storage space for my files, some of my music, pics, that sort of thing. Have also run portable applications on it and they seem to perform well for the most part. Overall, a solid little card with just enough speed to get the majority of my tasks done.Sidenote: the card came formatted with exFAT by default. The onyl way I could downgrade to FAT32 was to use a third party app. For some reason, the card can\\'t be read by my phone, but the phone is an older model Samsung, so that could be the issue. Easy to load, super fast, great for pictures and HD video on my phone. Really happy with this purchase. Just don\\'t have enough stuff to fill it! Works great. Got it quickly, it was well packed, plugged it in an it\\'s been working fine since. Only been a month so can speak to long term reliability. Will buy another one soon. I bought one for my note 3 and one for my girlfriend and her S4. She takes a lot of pictures and I have a lot of music on my phone so we both wanted the extra room. The cards read and write quickly also. I figured out why my old microSD card died on me.  When I plugged in my old Android phone at work, the antivirus software of my laptop wanted to scan the whole thing every time.  I was plugging it in to charge it, but the constant reads wore out the flash.  My new Android phone mounts as a CD drive (instead of the entire thing). I can only see the phone if I unmount my CD drive.  This is perfect for charging at work now.  Be careful with virus scanners if you have an Android phone that auto mounts your entire phone\\'s Micro SD! This chip is super fast.  If you\\'re going to use it in an Android device, I recommend formatting it in NTFS. A reliable brand name produce giving me lots of storage for music, videos and pictures. It\\'s so tiny. No one in say 1950 would believe what it does. This is the second one of these chips that I received.  The first either had a latent physical defect or damage in transit, but it snapped in half on first use.  I was really bummed, but determined to try again.  This was a breeze!  The chip blazes, doubled the capacity of the 32 GB chip it replaced in my ASUS TF700T tablet, and holds ALL of my music and documents with plenty of room left over!  I now have 128 GB available on my tablet, and it all works flawlessly.Anyone that is looking to upgrade needs to do a little due diligence in determining that your device is able to address 64 GB\\'s, but with that reservation, I strongly recommend this little gem!! Hi guys I have wrote this review three times and unfortunately doesn\\'t go through on Amazon\\'s website...LOLSo, with that said I will tell you that the write and read speeds are very fast and should be with the class 10.  Great price and fast delivery from Amazon!...Enjoy! Review for: SanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A),This product arrived via USPS, its not in any individual packing from the manufacturer, it was placed in an SD case together with the adapter.  So, I am unable to verify warranties or authenticity. The Samsung S3 recognized and formatted this with no problem.  It sees it as an external memory with 59GB.  The Six GB is probably allocated for FAT/File allocation table.  Will order again from this seller! Do not get this card especially if you plan on using it on an Android phone.  just google \"sd card unexpectedly removed\" and I found the problem is caused directly by this card.  I purchased a different brand and the problem immediately disappears.  Out of curiosity I tried mounting this card into a windows PC and on rare occasions the sd card does turn up empty, as if it was removed, so the problem is not limited to android.  I would avoid this card completely. Don\\'t know what exactly to say, but the little micro seems at least as efficient as any other micro that I\\'ve ever used. These things are supposed to work flawlessly aren\\'t they? Anyway this does. Didn\\'t need to format it in my S4 - went straight in no probs. It works great, I use it in my S3 to take HD movies and to store all my music.. bla No complains.  I have been using this card for a few weeks and have had no problems.  I am very pleased with it. 16+16GB=32GB. Lasts long time! Waaaaaaay cheaper than the 32GB version of the S3/iP4S/iP5! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Or get the 32GB for 48GB total... As described.  Haven\\'t had issues so far.  Put this into a Samsung tablet and it worked as expected after standard formatting. UPDATE 6/18/14: Well, I suppose nothing lasts forever. After almost a year, the card has gone bad. I use the card a lot in my smartphone - a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3 (SGH-T999). All my photos, voice recordings, and downloads go on this card, and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via USB cable. A few days ago, a video file I transferred to my computer refused to play correctly. No video, and the audio was skipping and squealing, which I recognize as the sound of a corrupted file. I thought maybe the transfer didn\\'t complete; tried it again, same result. I tried to play the file right on the phone, and it didn\\'t play on my phone! I knew there was a problem. I tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there, still no luck. Then I deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone, not the SD card - EUREKA. It played perfectly.I formatted the SDXC card twice - once from the phone and once through Windows - and tried the same test. Downloaded video file to the card, then to the phone. Same result both times - it wouldn\\'t play on the SD card, but it did on the phone. All videos used to play perfectly on the SD card. Finally, I swapped out the card for my older, Sandisk Ultra 32GB Micro SDXC card. Like magic, it worked perfectly no matter what I played on it. So yeah, the 64GB card is dead. I should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days ago.Thankfully, Sandisk Ultra products like this carry an incredible Lifetime warranty - or 10 years for regions that don\\'t recognize \"lifetime\"; their Extreme line of cards raise that to 30 years! I\\'ve contacted their support for an RMA so I\\'ll update this review as events unfold. If they replace it quickly, I\\'ll bump this back up to 5 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I\\'m using a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. Sandisk Ultra Micro SD cards have never failed me, and this one\\'s no exception. I used to have a 32gb card. They\\'re fast and reliable and never corrupt data, which is more than can be said for some cheaper brands like PNY (those fail quite often). I can\\'t wait to get the new 128GB model! Used it in an android phone. Worked fine and is decently fast. It did not quite reach the rated speeds but came close (could just be the controller that I am using). I bought three of these--one to replace my old 1 GB card and two for first-time users to add to their phone memory. These cards work fine, and none of the three had any trouble. For me 32 gb is sufficient. I don\\'t need more then this.Running easy, safety, and SanDisk is a great mark. I always use SanDisk so they were my first (and only) option when I got my GoPro.  They are fast and they are good.Can\\'t say too much, SanDisk makes the best cards, period. Top performance!  Have always had good luck with SanDisk, so based on my past experience with the &#34;name-brand&#34; I saw no reason to be hesitant!Past experience paid off!  Happy with my purchase! It got it because my sandisk 32gb was getting full and had about 2-3gb free. I have no almost filled this one up in a few months and have about 17gb free now. I am starting to need the new sandisk 128gb. I need money and storage. I have been using it without any problems coming up. My s4 treats it nice and I can get decent speeds of about 10-15mb/s transfer but I do hate waiting for a gb of 1080p footage to transfer but I guess I would rather have storage over speed. I would recommend it to anyone needing high storage at a cheap price. Its a good price and have never had any issues with the card deciding to stop recording. I have used it in a Hero3 and 3+ always recording in 1080p at 60fps. good buy on this card. was just what I needed for my tablet. super fast spead on this so up loading or down loading from my pc or laptop is fast. We bought 2 of these for our GSIII\\'s. No issues, fast read and writes and the price is right. Not a big surprise - another quality product from SanDisk. I bought this with Costco Black Friday deal and started using just a couple of days ago.  Today when I was transferring video files from my phone to the card, I wasn\\'t able to because it stopped half way.  Now, nothing can be written on it.It was purchased from Costco, so it\\'s not a fake Microsdhc card.  I tested it out its authenticity with an app on Google Play and verified that it\\'s real too.  Still, it\\'s a piece junk.  What is Sandisk doing to its reputation?I would advise shopper to choose other brands over this.  Surely, it\\'s cheap; but would you rather lose all of the important files that you store in it? Sandisk never disappoint.  For a 64gin micro-disk, this thing is super fast.  Using it in my new Galaxy Note 2, Amazing !! This memory card holds a ton of information. I use it for video and it holds 1080p videos like a champ. [[ UPDATE - 6/19/2014 ]]So my lovely wife bought me a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 for Father\\'s Day and I\\'ve been loving it ever since.  Just as other with Samsung products, the Galaxy Tab 4 has the ability to add a microSD card to expand the memory on the device.  Since it\\'s been over a year, I decided to do some more research to see if SanDisk offered anything new.  As of 6/19/2014, their product lineup for microSD cards from worst to best (performance-wise) are the as follows:SanDiskSanDisk UltraSanDisk Ultra PLUSSanDisk ExtremeSanDisk Extreme PLUSSanDisk Extreme PRONow, the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read/write data to the card.  Yes, the published rating of most all these cards (except the SanDisk regular) are Class 10/UHS-I but that\\'s just a rating... Actual real world performance does get better with each model, but with faster cards come more expensive prices.  Since Amazon doesn\\'t carry the Ultra PLUS model of microSD card, I had to do direct comparisons between the SanDisk Ultra ($34.27), Extreme ($57.95), and Extreme PLUS ($67.95).As mentioned in my earlier review, I purchased the SanDisk Ultra for my Galaxy S4.  My question was, did I want to pay over $20 more for a card that is faster than the one I already owned?  Or I could pay almost double to get SanDisk\\'s 2nd-most fastest microSD card.The Ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage (storing/capturing pictures & HD video and movie playback) on my phone.  So in the end, I ended up just buying another SanDisk Ultra 64GB card.  I use my cell phone *more* than I do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone, it\\'s good enough for my tablet.  I don\\'t own a 4K HD camera or anything like that, so I honestly didn\\'t see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time.I am now a proud owner of 2 SanDisk Ultra cards and have absolutely 0 issues with it in my Samsung devices.[[ ORIGINAL REVIEW - 5/1/2013 ]]I haven\\'t had to buy a microSD card in a long time. The last time I bought one was for my cell phone over 2 years ago. But since my cellular contract was up, I knew I would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone, the Samsung Galaxy S4. Reason for this is because I knew my small 16GB microSD card wasn\\'t going to cut it.Doing research on the Galaxy S4, I wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity (32 GB or greater). This led me to find that the Galaxy S4 supports the microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I card, which is the fastest possible given that class. Searching for that specifically on Amazon gave me results of only 3 vendors (as of April) that makes these microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 cards. They are Sandisk (the majority), Samsung and Lexar. Nobody else makes these that are sold on Amazon.Seeing how SanDisk is a pretty good name out of the 3 (I\\'ve used them the most), I decided upon the SanDisk because Lexar was overpriced and the Samsung one was overpriced (as well as not eligible for Amazon Prime).But the scary thing is that when you filter by the SanDisk, you literally get DOZENS of options. All of them have different model numbers, different sizes, etc. Then there\\'s that confusion of what\\'s the difference between SDHC & SDXC?SDHC vs SDXC:SDHC stand for \"Secure Digital High Capacity\" and SDXC stands for \"Secure Digital eXtended Capacity\". Essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that SDHC only supports capcities up to 32GB and is formated with the FAT32 file system. The SDXC cards are formatted with the exFAT file system. If you use an SDXC card in a device, it must support that file system, otherwise it may not be recognizable and/or you have to reformat the card to FAT32.FAT32 vs exFAT:The differences between the two file systems means that FAT32 has a maximum file size of 4GB, limited by that file system. exFAT on the otherhand, supports file sizes up to 2TB (terabytes). The only thing you need to know here really is that it\\'s possible your device doesn\\'t support exFAT. If that\\'s the case, just reformat it to FAT32. REMEMBER FORMATTING ERASES ALL DATA!To clarify the model numbers, I I hopped over to the SanDisk official webpage. What I found there is that they offer two \"highspeed\" options for SanDisk cards. These are SanDisk Extreme Pro and SanDisk Ultra. SanDisk Extreme Pro is a line that supports read speeds up to 95MB/sec, however they are SDHC only. To make things worse, they are currently only available in 16GB & 8GB capacities. Since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage, I ruled these out.The remaining devices listed on Amazon\\'s search were the SanDisk Ultra line. But here, confusion sets in because SanDisk separates these cards to two different devices. Cameras & mobile devices. Is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt? Unfortunately I\\'m not sure but I do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars. Since I wasn\\'t sure, I opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices (just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue). To find the exact model number, I would go to Sandisk\\'s webpage (sandisk.com) and compare their existing product lineup. From there, you get exact model numbers and you can then search Amazon for these model numbers. That is how I got mine (SDSDQUA-064G).As for speed tests, I haven\\'t run any specific testing, but copying 8 GB worth of data from my PC to the card literally took just a few minutes.One last note is that Amazon attaches additional characters to the end (for example SDSDQUA-064G-AFFP-A vs SDSDQUA-064G-U46A). The difference between the two is that the \"AFFP-A\" means \"Amazon Frustration Free Packaging\". Other than that, these are exactly the same.  If you\\'re wondering what I got (and want to use it in your Galaxy S4), I got the SDSDQUA-064G-u46A and it works like charm. I inserted this little gem in to my new NOOK HD and let me tell you....WOW.  She loves it so much and she won\\'t give it back!  Instead of buying larger capacity tablets....just buy the smallest amount of gigs and buy one of these little dudes. I bought this one for my tablet... well it is very fast. durable and long lasting... I recommend this item...So get one now. I wished it came with some sort of USB converter so I can transfer files faster to my PC. I am using a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and File transfer speed is mediocre. I purchased this for my go pro hero 3... Its a solid card, but unless your planning to buy several I would recommended going with the 64 gig. At the higher capture setting you can only get a little over an hour or so of video time. A standard when it comes to high capacity mobile memory.  Grated, if you have an older android phone, or older tablet, you probably won\\'t see much difference.  But if you have a modern device like a galaxy s4, or note 3, or equivalent mobile device, you\\'ll definitely notice the difference in data transfer and access in your device.  For modern phones, a UHS-1 memory card is a must.  The only reason I didn\\'t give this product five stars is because it\\'s not a sandisk extreme, or a sandisk extreme pro.  But then again, you must have EXTREMELY specific needs to want to get 85MB/s transfer speeds on a mobile device.  For movies, music and apps, this one is more that adequate. I bought this for use with my gopro hero 3 silver and I have had no complaints. trhgtr thth h r Works great and faster than a conventional memory card. videos, pictures and access run smoother. highly recomnended for those who are in need of great space. I bought this for my Sony Action Cam, it gives me more than 8 hours of video using 1080 with 30 fps. No question, it is really as fast as it\\'s rated. How fast? Well, class &#34;10 SDHC&#34; means literally SD format, HC=High Capacity, Class 10 = 10MB/sec read-write. How fast is 10MB per second? Well, Class 4, the most common step down (i.e. cheaper) is Class 4, i.e. 4MB/sec. So Class 10 is 2.5 times faster. Why pay the difference?Digital cameras: at some point the number of pictures/sec or HD video is bottle-necked by the speed of the media it is being recorded to.Smart phones? I have a Samsung Note II. A Quad-core processor, wiz-bang yadda-yadda. Yes, I DO notice speed differences in camera, app performance (I use a spreadsheet app/browser/NetFlix/Music streaming, et al) is noticeably FASTER. Where do you think the phone stores stuff to when it doesn\\'t use the factory installed memory? (iPhomes don\\'t have an SD slot, and I wouldn\\'t own a phone or tablet that doesn\\'t -- I believe in choice in the computer realm)Oh yeah, SanDisk is a leader and pioneer in the SD format (where do you think the \\'SD\\' came from?). The only other SDHC Class 10 card worthy of comparison is the Samsung brand, but then I might be biased on that one. Used this card in my Galaxy S3 and have had no problems.  Tons-o-room for what ever you want and more. After a small preasure while trying to remove it from a device it got brokenAlso, the I/O speed is not amazing, even for a Class 10 Soon as I got this, I popped the back of my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and put this in. The Note 2 recognized it instantly and I was able to move my mp3s from the internal memory to this external memory and was playing music in short order. i love this memory card, i use it with my galaxy s 2 smartphone and couldnt be happier, its very fast, when i take photos the phone doesnt stutter like it did with my old memory card, a definive must buy if your a power user and can afford it. Great Price and works great with my Samsung galaxy s4.Such a relief not having to worry about space for pix and apps. Definitely, SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A) is working as advertised. I\\'m definitely happy about this product. The price was definitely worth it. it has it all, I got at great price....but speed, and reliability are the strenghts of this thing. USing it on a GN 8.0 and performs The problem with rating and reviewing an item such as this one is.. does it work or not..  My experience with SanDisk memory cards has been they work and can take a beating.. and a washing...  what else can I ask for? Got this for my GoPro Black Edition to record up to 4-5 hours of video at the highest setting. Very pleased with its performance and so far no errors or failures. Bought this for use in my phone to expand the memory in it. I have the 32GB GS3. I wanted to double the memory of my phone but I wasn\\'t sure if my phone would take a 32GB card; it did and I\\'m happy with the product, I also loved the easy-open cardboard packaging. I like that it\\'s easier to open and ship but mostly I like that it\\'s not plastic since I hate the excess trash that puts in landfills. I have to assume that the brand new 64gb SanDisk Ultra Class 10 SDXC card is responsible for the occasional video recording stutter/pausing that has happened since I started using it today.  Prior to that, never had an issue with my previous SanDisk SDHC card.  But today on its maiden trip, it has led each video (only 3-5 minutes long each) to have several performance issues that by default I have to attribute to the card since nothing else has changed and I\\'ve never had an issue in the four months that I\\'ve had my Galaxy Note 2.  No problems formatting this card though or installing/using it otherwise. Great Product. Works perfectly with my Canon Camcorder. Very responsive and fast.Enough capacity for 8 hours video and great price. Grabbed in thanksgiving 2012. A ton of storage, fast transfer speeds, not much more to say. I used this on a Samsung vibrant and Nexus 4 This sd card is great for my note 3. worked perfectly for almost half a year. I would recommend it to everyone. Good price for a good size micro SD.  Not the fastese card that I have used but for the price I am satisfied. Overall good memory card. It is fast and it even comes with an adapter. Fits in my camera perfectly and picture taking has been a breeze. would recommmend to others. I installed this item into my Dell Venue 8 Pro and it has worked just fine at housing my programs.  I\\'m very happy with this device. No complaints as yet.....It came with an adapter as advertised. I wished that I had purchased two instead of one. If you have to have the max storage on your phone... this is it. Not only is it the fastest class available, it is the ONLY decent 128 card available right now. Not a bad price, either. A great product and a very reasonable price.  It has increased the Galaxy Tab 2 memory and useability without having to deal with other interface cables. i like it, good product next time i will order the bigger memory. i will recomend this product to my friends Just started unmounting and remounting all by itself.  Really sucked the battery life for a while there. A quick google search showed this to be a common problem.  Oh well... Phone is a galaxy s3 from virgin. Still getting sd card unexpectedly removed but I do know it\\'s an issue with the phone and not the card. Perfect for HD video production. This will hold a lot of stills and videos with a reasonable write speed - No complaints... Great micro sd card and for 35$ its extremely cheap. Got 2 of thoses and i`ve never looked back. UHS1 = fast! This Sandisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter really work like it suppose too, I will ordering another soon. As soon as it was inserted into the Samsung Galaxy S4 it started getting filled up in a trip to NYC. It is great not having to empty photos and music off the phone, and the phone still works fast, which is good considering SD cards with apps tend to make Android phones slow. Great quality from SanDisk! This card is made by a good company and it works well. Its lightning fast and gets the job done. Its a memory card so not really much to talk about other than the fact that it holds info and accesses and stores info very fast.. THIS SANDISK 16 MICROSDHC  WORKED PERFEC FOR WHAT I WANTED  TO USEDI USED FOR VIDEOS AND MUSICDEFINITALY I RECOMMEND THIS It does what it should, came a the right price and was shipped quickly.  I can now store many extra things on my phone...! Excellent delivery time, and the memory feels to read and write pretty fast.  I have a previous experience with a class 4 16GB micro sd.  This is a lot faster. Put the memory card in my Microsoft Surface RT and it worked fantastic. No formatting, no setup, it was ready to go right off the bat, plus the price was the best I could find anywhere. I purchased this card for use in my helmet mounted video camera. All memory cards are NOT the same and as correctly stated by a previous reviewer even cards rated the same Class number don\\'t perform the same. This card performs well in sub-zero temperatures when catching ski-ing action and also high speed flying action in Southern CA in very high temperatures in a black camera. I did not measure the actual data speed, but it captured 1080p HD 30fps video from my camera without any issues.Overall this card is good value, performs well and I would recommend it. I bought it for my grand daughters camera, but when my 64gb memory refused to work with my Windows tablet, I swapped them and this one is working splendidly. I have had the 32gb in my Galaxy S3 for almost three months and there were no issues. However, the phone just recently started telling me the card has unrecognized files or it is empty, causing the loss of my media. I chose to format it after seeing the error for too long, chalking it up to some random error. Somehow, yesterday, all of the files on my card magically reappeared and I was able to play my music again, despite having had the phone format the card. Shortly afterwards, the error reappeared. I put the card in my computer and it is simply not appearing. Shame, but I think this is a risky card to purchase. So far I have not have any problems with this memory, the transfer speed is good and it works just great on my Samsung Note 8 Adds a really nice support of memory for any device. I enjoy not worrying about running out of space now. I normally buy the SanDisk Extreme for my GoPro but decided to try the Ultra to save some money.  So far it seems to work good.  I have not tried to shoot at 4K yet although it seems like it would work. This device works in Galaxy S4 no problems, it woks perfectly and really I just can\\'t get over that you can buy a 64GB storage device that is the size of my thumbnail, that will run programs from it for under $50.One day something like this will hold 64 TB. Crazy cool. I screwed up and orignally order wrong card.  So I needed this card quickly for a trip.  Ordered it and it arrived and put it in tablet andloaded it with files.  It has worked flawlessly for about a month now.Thanks The recent map update on my Garmin GPS ran it out of memory.  Maps are getting more and more detailed.  I used this to up the memory and got back to the Full North America Map. It cam with the adapter to fit my PC SD slot too. Used it on my GoPro Hero 3 and works great found SanDisk to always make excellent products. Money well spent. Lots of room, enough speed and everything that I need portable is going along for the ride. No loss of data for me. Great price on this product.  Half of what Samsung was charging for the same memory card. Works just fine in my Notewith no pproblems what so ever. These cards worked flawlessly with the GoPro Hero 3+. Instead of opting for the bigger card, I got two smaller cards to start with. That way I could transfer data to my laptop while still using the other card. If you\\'re wanting to do an un-assisted, large record, like a time-lapse, or something, opting for the bigger card is smart, but for my usage being able to swap back and forth was invaluable.So far, no hiccups or problems, even with the faster, more beefy shooting settings. Is exactly what you can expect from a memory card. Nothing more nothing less. I tested the card in my GopRo Hero3 and it worked. It is very fast , I like it And I think if you have one you will like it I think. Works really well in my Motorola Razor MAXX. Good price for the size of this SD card. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I can\\'t wait until the prices drop more and the capacity goes up. This was my first time adding an SD card to a Smart Phone. I just got a Nokia Lumia 1520 and with such an excellent screen I wanted to be able to play movies on it for trips or to watch at my desk while working.So far I have put 6 albums and 6 Hi Def movieson the card and still have 20gb to spare. Everything loads up just as fast as if it was stored on the phone\\'s internal memory.Very happy with this little guy. I bought this because it was super cheap on black Friday or cyber Monday week ( whatever that means ) . It is great. I bought it thinking that it might be better in my Galaxy s2 but I have not noticed any difference in speed. I guess it is more for HD video recording or picture taking in a camera. first off i got mine at wal-mart but i\\'m considering the 64GB version as of now but the 16GB card i have is really fast i\\'ve actually transferred all i can to it from my Galaxy SIII because for what ever reason it reads of the card faster than it does from the phones internal 16GB of memory?!?!? i\\'ve always used snadisk stuff everything from flash drives, sd cards, and now even a SSD! they make great stuff This SD card USED to be one of the fastest. Now it is merely adequate.I bought the 64GB version and inserted into my Samsung Galaxy S5 (latest Samsung phone).The performance, although still adequate, is less than stellar. For example, to load the Amazon Kindle app, which is about 35mb and I purposely placed it into this SD card, it takes about 7 full seconds to load. The same app on my iPad takes around 2 seconds to load.Still, if you aren\\'t too much into your smartdevice performance, then I wouldn\\'t worry. But if you do care about how fast your smartphone can take pictures (assuming your pictures are stored in SD cards) or how fast your apps will load, then you should purchase a much faster SD card for your latest phone.Pros:1)Adequate performance.2)Hassle free packaging.Cons:1)Not the fastest, but still adequate. Was not expecting a micro 30 MB within a standard ScanDisk.  Not much to write.  Performs as it should without any hassle. Best 64 gigs of micro SD out there. No lag accessing data for the smartphone, acts like the phone\\'s own internal storage and is indistinguishable from it. The integrity of the data is well preserved. Bought for use with my GroPro and this card allows my to video for as long as my batteries will allow.  Must have for a GoPro user! Bought for my phone and its worked perfectly for quite a while now. Great size and great price. Cant go wrong with this. Installed this a few days after receiving my Galaxy Note III can stuff it with more music than most Ipods, and tons of movies.I\\'ve not had any problems, and it is fast! Would recommend. I have 2 of those, one in phone one in tablet. Probably i will get one more for GF. After using an 8 Gig microsd in my galaxy s3 for a year, I knew I needed a new sd card when I got the s4. This sd card has worked out really well for me. I am no longer worried about running out of space when I take pictures on my new s4. A great performer for the price ... The capacity is limitless ... The speed is superb too considering it\\'s in a smartphone :) Every SanDisk card I\\'ve ever bought has never disappointed me and this one wasn\\'t the exception. I use one with my Galaxy Tab 3 and so far it has performed superbly and I have zero complaints.I realize there are quite a few bad reviews for this card but I have never ran into a bad SanDisk card and I hope I won\\'t in the future. I feel bad for the ppl who get the ONE bad card in a batch of thousands, but yeah, it happens. It\\'s a memory card. It works. What else do I need to say. I\\'ll be using it in a data logging project soon. I use this with my GoPro Hero 3 camera and it works great, no issues and perfect size and price. does what it should ... 64 gigs in such a tiny physical space is crazy ... makes my phone\\'s capacity huge.  if you use it in an mp3 player, you will have to convert it to fat 32, but it isn\\'t hard; there are plenty of free programs out there you can download.  so this WILL work in those devices as well ... sweet. I bought this and put it my mobile phone - Samsung galaxy s3. I don\\'t have a lot more to say. I put it in, formatted it, and it has been working very ewell for some months now. Seems to be very fast. No issues. Recommended. Not much to say about the product , there is no configuration needed.it works out of the box, no need to format it unless if you want to.Speed? The tablet processor speed and the card make it impossible for you to see any delay. I am recommand it for anybody that have burchase those 16 GB tablet or phone. Specially if you have pictures and musics that you need to keep. The market carries 64 GB and up so make your best judgment and save. I was surprised as to how fast I recieved the Sandisk Micro SD I ordered. I ordered one before but it took almost 2 weeks. I recieved this one within 2 days. I plan to use this one for my next Android phone. I want to upgrade to a Samsung Galaxy model. I was instructed that most phones can handle up to 32gbs but found out that they can handle more. HI ....  My Son Wanted/Needed - to make this Purchase,  Hence - The Purchase ..........He\\'s Completely Satisfied with this Item, and Has No-Problem with it ........ &#34; HE LOVES IT !&#34;REGARDS,  JCN OH my gosh this is the greatest invention since sliced bread. I am totaled underwhelmed and it works too. xx xx Picked up several when they were discounted. work great in my Galaxy S4 phone, wifes Nikon V1 and my GoPro. No failures or inability to recognize card. Highly recommend ScanDisk products. Works great in my compatible device BUT if you think you can reformat to FAT32 and us in an older device only designed for 32GB you will likely experience excess battery drain even if you think it is working fine to start with. I use a Sony camera with fairly high megapixels per picture.  I also tend to snap many shots in a row.  So the buffering speed of cards like this is important.  On a recent trip abroad, during which I took 3000 pictures...sometimes using the panorama function...I never ran into any processing delays.  The camera and card let me just keep snapping.  Cards like this are noticed only if they don\\'t perform.  They are otherwise just &#34;there,&#34; which is a good thing.  This one seems to perform.  Obviously, not a technical evaluation, just a layman\\'s assessment after using this card for a while. Does what it says it does, and does it like it says it will.  Installed in my Galaxy S5, no issues, and no complaints. This worked really well for me. I used it in a GoPro camera for recording a couple of hours of video. Love the storage space. The SanDisk memory card is awesome. I usually only buy SanDisk products because they are very reliable. Very good quality. I have other brands, but prefer Sandisk. I have several and have never had an error or failure. I often shoot video in 2.7k at a high bitrate and this memory card can keep up. That\\'s important to me.I would highly recommend this card. I\\'ve always bought SanDisk SD cards, and have never been disappointed. This one is no exception. I\\'m using it in my Galaxy S III and have no problems. Transfer speeds are as advertised. Great card, great price. This arrived quickly and was the actual product that was described, unlike what others committed about this item.  It works and does just what I needed it for.  Thanks. this was installed in my S4, I had no issues like others have posted, in fact I formatted in the computer and  popped it right in. I am always perfectly satisfied with SanDisk products; they are extremely reliable and suit my purposes perfectly.  This particular memory card is no exception. I bought this extra memory for my Samsung Galaxy S4.  I wish I had known when I bought my phone that Android changed its memory management technique between Gingerbread and Jelly Bean!  Verizon sold me a 16GB Samsung S4.  I didn\\'t do much research since my old phone broke and I was about to leave on a business trip the next day.  Come to find out, there are 32 and 64GB versions of the Galaxy S4!  I never asked Verizon if they even carried different versions.  Well, I figured that wouldn\\'t be a problem... I\\'ll just put in a 64GB Micro SD (TF) Card and I\\'ll be all set.  Unfortunately you can no longer transfer Apps to the Micro SD Card.  Some apps can store data on the SD Card but there is no longer the ability to \"Move to SD.\"  Since I travel internationally, I use a lot of GPS mapping software and would like to download multiple Gigs of map data for offline mapping.  As of now, I can only download this to my phone\\'s 16GB memory, and not to this 64GB memory card!  Pictures (except for burst photos), videos and music can all be put on the 64GB SD card.  All that being said, this memory card works well, and is priced on par with all of the other comparable cards on the market.  If you\\'ve got the cash and need the space (for music, videos/movies and/or pictures--just not apps) then I recommend picking one of these up. The device works as advertised. It had a tremendous price. I have found that it did not need formatting to work in my Galaxy Note 3. The amount of space reserved for my purposes was most excellent. I would definitely buy this device again. This works great just like all SanDisk chips I have had. It\\'s being used in My girlfriends Samsung Galaxy S3. works good on my phone, now I can listen to music for hours and hours.  now all I need to do is remember to bring my charger to work. And does it fast. Been installed in my Acer Iconia Tab for months and has endured file transfer after file transfer with not a single glitch. Great memory card!  Can be used as a micro sd or regular because it comes with a the larger disc case that it fits into. I use this with my samsung galaxy note 3 and it performs pretty darn well. Write and read speed safe good and it stores all my photos no prob. I bought this for my GoPro HD Hero 3 camera, as it was the one recommended by most buyers. I\\'ve had zero problems with the card, and the included adaptor makes it easy to transfer my videos to my PC. These things are tiny though, and thin so be careful not to bend or lose them! The $24 price is reasonable as well. This is my first foray into the microSD card world. I bought this for my GoPro Hero3 white.Pros:- comes with an adapter for easy downloading.- simple to format right out of the box.- reads/writes just fine with no errors.Cons:- the adapter has no spring return like the devices you instert the card into - removing the card from the adapter can be a pain.Overall it\\'s great and does what I need it to do.Hope that helps... I bought this for memory storage in a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 to replace one that was unreliable just prior to leaving on vacation. It worked without problem. When I returned from vacation, I returned the defective one to Sandisk for a replacement and I now have two. It doesn\\'t write as fast as my larger 32G SD card so I probably won\\'t try to use it in an HD video camera. Works great, low cost, fast, and the bright red makes it easier to find when it gets dropped or misplaced. SanDisk is usually my go to brand for removable media. Bought this for my new Samsung Galaxy S4. Works great, no problems with transfer speed. No failures with it so far, so I would suggest this to anyone. I got this because the GoPro Hero3 doesn\\'t come with any memory cards whatsoever.Works great, especially for 4K recording on the Hero3 Black Edition.These things are so small though, easy to lose if you don\\'t keep it in the camera, or in the Adapter.Super Fast Download with a USB 3.0 Memory Card Reader. It\\'s a giant, fast micro-SD card for your phone. It works and it\\'s reasonably priced. I\\'ve swapped this card through the past 3 phones I\\'ve owned and it continues to serve me well on the road. You can bring along enough 1080p movies for a 20 hour flight (or several of them) and still have plenty of room left over.The only downside is that it isn\\'t even more capacity. But really, 64gb is probably overkill. This is the second one of these that I\\'ve purchased.  The first was inexpensive, quick, and easy to install in my wife\\'s Samsung tablet.  I was so impressed that I bought another to install in my Samsung. Reading through the reviews I expected to have to jump through a hoop, or do something crazy special to make this work. The instructions say only up to 32gb is supported in my device.The card arrived. I chose the hassle free packaging... BEST CHOICE EVER! Inserted into the phone, booted up and chose format just in case on the card. The card formatted and I was presented with around 59gb free. Easiest ever. Very happy being able to start moving my music from the ever so aging iTunes to the card. The read and write speeds are more than acceptable, much faster than any of the other microsd cards that I have. I\\'m a very technical user, but would have felt very comfortable with talking my mother through such an easy procedure. I am going to assume it would work the same for the galaxy siii (S3).Not much more you can say about a boat ton of storage in a small container. 5 star! I bought this card for my hero3 because the 64 GB card that i bought with the camera is not readable on my Ipad4. This card has been through its paces and supplies great video that I can review on my ipad immediately, with supplied SD adapter. I got this for my GoPro camera in order to record high frame rates at 1080p and it keeps up just fine. I\\'ve never had any issues with it under those circumstances. Got this to go in my daughters Microsoft Surface RT and it is doing great! She loaded a movie on it and is happy her device has some extra memory :-) SanDisk 16GB Micro SDHCWorks as advertised.Good Quality.Pretty inexpensive price considering.I would recommend it to anyone in need of a micro sd card. I get the occasional dropped frames when using it to record HD video in HD camera. Solid for the 1 couple of weeks. Time will tell. Purchased for use with a smartphone.  Works flawlessly, has given me much more space than I think I can use - but we\\'ll see.  That\\'s what I always say at the beginning.  It works without me noticing it is there so to me that is what I pay for.  I think this was a great price and I\\'m pleased with the purchase. No problems here, works perfectly fine just as expected. Threw it into my Surface Pro to get a little more storage capabilities (for music, media, etc.). Had to format to use which I didn\\'t realize at first, but that\\'s my fault for being an idiot in the first place. No complaints, fine product, would recommend. Works flawlessly in a GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition. Great card for the price and fits plenty of footage, especially when you have 2 of them. I use this with my Samsung Note II.  Previously I had iPhones, but it is very expensive to get an iPhone with enough memory for all my songs.  For a fraction of the price with my Samsung, they\\'re all there wherever a go. Used on a Galaxy Note and so far it has been great, fast card and excelent brand, a+ performance !Update may 10 2013, it stopped working! It does not work with my Galaxy Note or my PC, sadly it is not recognized by any device... I bought this memory card specifically to add extra storage on my Samsung Galaxy S3. It was very easy to install in the phone and it recognized the card instantly. I turned the phone off before I removed the back cover and installed the card. I am not sure if this is needed, but I figured it wouldn\\'t hurt by doing it that way. After it was installed and recognized, I formatted the card through the phone options. The card is very fast when writing to it or reading from it.I would definitely recommend this card to others, especially if you have a Galaxy S3 and want some more storage space on it. When you buy a Micro SD card and you get a class 4, your apps will run slow and your camera will be slow. Spend the money on a class 10 for the speed of the card to ensure your device works up to its full potential. Listen to me, I am a certified Geek. This is great!  This is why I don\\'t buy Apple products and get charged up the @$$ for non-expandable memory.  Expandable memory is dirt cheap these days for how much you get and it\\'s more reliable than Apple.  Works like a charm.  I\\'ve got two of these, one in  my phone and one in my tablet, and I\\'ve never had any problem or inconvenience with either of them. I bought this card to go with my new Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition.  After using it for a few days with only the onboard storage, I felt the need to have a little more space.  The price for this card was just right, and I have always had great success with SanDisk memory devices, whether they are USB or SD or what have you.  I use this card to take all sorts of music and movies with me whenever I have to go anywhere, and there is absolutely no lag or hiccuping on playback.  I also set this card as the default to store photos and videos taken with the tablet, and there is no noticeable delay when taking photos.  This card works so well, I just bought a second one to replace an old 8GB card in my phone. This works well in my Galaxy S4. I use it for media storage. I did have to reseat it once as I kept getting an error about \"Preparing SD Card,\" but I think that was more about how I put it in my phone than about this media. I think that this is a pretty good value to extend storage on a phone.UPDATE - I deducted a star because this card has a capacity of 32 billion bytes, but not 32 GB. There is a difference. The storage is actually around 29 GB because 32,000,000,000 / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 = 29.8 GB. It\\'s still a very good value and I would still recommend it highly, but do understand that you are not getting 32 GB. super fast card and it has lots of space. great for movies and pictures and music and other stuff. Its awesome Card works great in my GoPro Hero 3 White Edition. I did a 48 hour time lapse and had no issues whatsoever with corrupted data or missing files. I\\'ve always had good experiences with SanDisk products and recommend them to everyone. good price for a 64gb card. purchased it to go along with the Hero3 camera. Just what I needed to complete the set This was purchased for my cell phone. It was easy to plugged in, and my phone recognized it instantly.The adaptor that comes with the device I had some problems with. The adaptor has a write protection switch, that both my Toshiba and HP laptops like to turn on while inserting it into the SD slot. To get around this I have to insert this adaptor at a slight angle, and apply a little pressure to try and not let that switch get changed on insertion. It works, but it is a pain. Fortunately since the chip is in my phone 99% of the time it is not a pain I deal with too often. It is something that may need to be considered though if you plan on using this device primarily in the standard sized SD slot of a laptop or computer. Got this on sale! What a deal! I got the 16GB card for my Garmin GPS. The GPS\\'s memory could be expanded so that more maps and info could be saved. The memory card works as described. I\\'ve used Sandisk for many electronics and I have never had a problem. They are sometimes a little more expensive than other brands but I think the little extra is worth it. I got this for a Microsoft Surface.  It does exactly what I wanted it to do (wish the Surface was more user friendly with it though... but, that\\'s another story).  One thing to watch out for: this will not work in older SDHC compliant devices.  I tried it in my D80 and it wouldn\\'t work at all.  That\\'s not a problem with the device so much as with the buyer knowing what they are buying. I have no complaints. It works great in my GoPro. I never worry about running out of space when filming on dives. I usually go on multiple dives in one day and shoot a lot of 20-30 second video clips to share with family and friends on the web. I never come close to running out of storage space. There was absolutely no issue with compatibility with my GoPro. Crashed... Lost everything... Thanks SanDisk.  Used in gs4..not a solid product couple years worth of stuff gone in an instant. These have issues with gopro, do not use. The transfer speed is inaccurate, and gopro has even admitted it doesn\\'t support this. this sd card died shortly after i got it, but sandisk\\'s RMA policy is so awesome i had a new sd card within 2 days.the new card is fine and  this was one of the best return experiences i\\'ve had. Bought this along with my GoPro Hero 3 and it\\'s been in that ever since. It\\'s nice to have a ridiculous amount of storage while running around with a GoPro because who wants to have to change chips when you\\'re out on a jetski... or falling out of a plane from 15,000 feet? This little guy adds a ton of extra space on my Samsung GS3 for all my music and more! Worth the money I had bought this card for my new Samsung Galaxy S3. The card is about as good as you can expect for the price and technology you\\'re paying for.SDXC cards come formatted in exFAT by default, which is what I would have tried to format it as anyway and seen if my phone supports that filesystem. In addition to being a faster format, enabling higher transfer rates, exFAT also takes up less storage space than, say, an FAT or FAT32 filesystem would - which is important when considering mobile storage devices.I read several poor reviews about this product starting that it simply stopped working after a few months. While that can happen from regular use, as it has happened to me in the past with a couple 32GB SDHCs, I would venture to say it was an error in use. Flash media is very sensitive in regards to \"hard shutdowns\". that\\'s to say, just pulling it out of your device or card reader without first unmounting it. Within the \\'Data Storage\\' menu on Android phones, there is an option to \\'unmount SD card\\'. I would recommend that you ALWAYS select this before removing any external memory card to avoid corruption of data and, ultimately, the card itself. The reason for this is that sudden stoppage of a flash memory device\\'s data or power connectivity can easily result in corruption.Transversely, if you have the memory card plugged into a card reader, say, with an SD adapter; you should first \"Eject\" the card. In Windows, there is a small icon located in the taskbar notification menu for \"Safely Remov[ing] Hardware and Eject[ing] Media\". Select the card and a notification will pop-up that the card is now safe to remove. It basically severs the same function as the Android \\'unmount\\' optional but will also cease any current read/write operations to avoid data or device corruption.I cannot speak for how one would do this on a Mac OS but chances are, if you\\'re using an Apple PC, you don\\'t have an Android phone. Holds lots of data with fast read/write capabilities. Sometimes I wish I had gone for the 64GB version, but the 32GB is great for adding memory to a SSD tablet like the Surface Pro. There are a lot of reports about 64gb cards not working in the Gopro hero 3. The 32Gb works great for me. I ordered this memory card for my Drift Ghost-S action camera. I started getting errors and the camera was freezing and saying there was a storage problem. I assumed the camera was faulty and actually exchanged it for another camera. Same errors. I switched to a SanDisk Extreme card and never had problems again.If you\\'re going to be recording HD video, especially at high frame rates then do not get this card. I\\'m sure it would be fine in any other scenario though, but it\\'s advertised as a class 10/UHS 1 card and it\\'s just not as fast as other class 10/UHS 1 cards.Drift Innovation (the company that makes the Ghost-S camera I use) has stated in multiple support tickets with me not to use any \"SanDisk Ultra cards\" because they do not perform fast enough for the camera and will result in slow card errors. They work ok until you try recording 1080p video at higher frame rates. I bought this to save music (MP3) and movies (MP4) for my ASUS MeMO Pad HD 7 and it works great. It worked fine at a start and offered great speeds, but after a few months my cell phone started to eject and reconnect it several times per day (at least once per hour).  That made my phone eat up its whole battery life in half the time.  I installed Watchdog and noticed that the Google+ process also incremented its CPU usage.  I read somewhere that it was caused by this kind of problems with microSD cards, probably because the process was trying to scan the memory once inserted.  In another forum there are also reports of this kind of problems with some of the latest generation SanDisk microSD cards.Now I decided to purchase a Samsung one which can be found similarly priced.  My phone stopped acting up, and its battery life came back to normal. I am very happy this come very fast, good packed, I usually used but its fantastic so fast with my new cards I bought this new 32gb microsd card to replace an old 8gb microsd that had run out of space on my rooted htc inspire. It was easy to copy and paste from my computer and back to the new microsd card. What else can I say... this SanDisk 32 GB class 10 works like a charm in my Galaxy SII i9100 (unlocked). If you\\'re upgrading from an old smaller microSD card, I did this:1. Create a .img file of the old microSD with HDD Raw Copy Tool (freeware)2. Recover the saved .img file in the new microSD card with HDD Raw Copy Tool* Since the old microSD had only 8 GB, the new microSD card will have only 8 GB D:3. Install Minitool Partition wizard (freeware) and choose the new microSD.4. Choose the Move/Resize option.5. Drag the space to the full size of the new microSD card6. Don\\'t forget to Apply7. Put the microSD in your phone and there you go all your stuff and apps saved to the microSD working. This is a class 10 adapter, and it lives up to its billing! I currently use it in my Android phone. I use this for my cell phone ( Lumia 810 ) and it works fine. the transfer speed is a little slower than other memory cards I have used but not by much. Device works exactly as expected.  Holds a lot of music videos.  Would recomment to anyone.  Great product!  What else can I say! I purchased this for my GoPro Hero3+ Black Edition and it works PERFECTLY!I use my GoPro for car riding, snowboarding, cliff jumping and much more.The 64GB SanDisk will for sure capture every moment of my life. It\\'s a storage device - a very small one physically, but it holds a lot. Great to add capacity to a tablet or cell.  This one does what it is supposed to do. It stores files in various formats. What more to ask for? A lower price I suppose. If you can wait a year, you\\'ll doubtless have that. I bought this for my MS Surface tablet and this tripled my storage space.  I copy all my media to this and have endless hours of entertainment when I\\'m on a plane ride or in hotels. I put this in my mom\\'s ASUS Transformer Book T100TA-C1-GR to provide an ample amount of storage for all pictures, music, and movies. This performs very well and we\\'ve experience 0 lag so far. Great product. Works! And why should I write more..... damn it! Eleven more words... finally am done with this, CRAP!! THREE MORE WORDS?? Needed an inexpensive SD card for my new HTC One M8 and this was a perfect choice.  Works perfectly and thus far have no issues at al with it. I have a MacBook Air and was curious if could put a TimeMachine backup on an SD Card.  For the experiment picked the SanDisk because:I\\'ve had great luck with their cards in the pastUsing a microSD gives me the most options with changing tech going forwardAmazon had it for $64 while it was $99 at Best Buy.Well guess what it works great!. There isn\\'t much more to be said.. First, there is the Sandisk name, Sandisk quality and Sandisk speed. The packaging was done well and shipping was not an issue.  As a professional for both video and photography, I\\'ve never had a Sandisk product fail me.  This unit was purchased specifically for my GoPro Hero 3+ Black, but could just as easily work in my Canon 5D mk III (with an adapter) in one of its dual slots. ...at an awesome price.  Bought a few of these for my Camera, GoPro, and phone.  Great Cyber Monday price and all work as advertised. Does everything it says without a hitch.  Works like a charm and reasonably priced, which makes it a good value too. Does what is suppose to do.  I purchased it for my Samsung Galaxy Tablet 2 7.0.  No problems or complaints. Using dbpoweramp I was able to rip my entire collection to this card at a reasonable quality level. That\\'s the point. Make sure it is compatible with your device before you buy. I use these in my tablet as well as my camera. I find slower speed cards do not work well when taking pictures or video. It would be nice if the SD adapter had built in WiFi, that way for my DSLR, I would only need to buy one WiFi card and simply replace it with these micro SD cards and save money. Use it in Sammy Tab 2, formatted in a HTC phone, then put in in the tab 2...... Works as expected.  What else can be said.  These cards are almost &#34;silly person&#34; proof, but looking at some reviews may say otherwise.  Amazon shipped it fast and I am happy. I currently have all my downloaded music on this car sitting in my surface RT.  I haven\\'t done any measurements on how fast the transfer rate of this card is, but I can tell you that it is fully capable of playing music and videos from the card to my Surface RT with no lag at all.  It was also a very good value as far as price/size/speed ratio. I have three of these cards now, being used between 2 devices. The oldest one is over a year old, and I just bought my third one. I\\'ve had no problems or errors of any kind, nor have I lost any data off any of them. I\\'d consider them a solid investment and great memory cards for the price per GB. They even see &#34;abuse&#34; in that they get used in a helmet sports cam sometimes, and all the shaking and hits haven\\'t affected my card\\'s ability to store video in the least. This San Disk Ultra is very fast and the 32 GB gives me lots of storage in my phone. I\\'ve got lots of room for apps, photos, music and other data, too. I\\'ll have lots of fun filling it up. I use this everyday with my Microsoft Surface and I\\'m very happy. No issues and great speed. Wish the prices would drop even more though. Got this for my girlfriend for the tablet I bought her, she love this as she can now put all the music and pictures on her tablet that she wants and doesn\\'t have to worry about running out of space anymore. The SD card arrived quickly and has worked ever since initial install. I have removed and used in adapter for laptop and put back in without issue. I\\'m using on Droid Razr M and always select unmount option in storage section prior to removal to ensure data is not lost. I have no complaints with this item. i bought this card to replace a 32GB card I purchased previously and suddenly stopped working. I paid a little more but some things are well worth it. I put a lot of MP3 files on my device so this card is great. Great name brand class 10 card.  Great price, best on the net at the time I bought this one.  It works perfectly and is fast.  Can\\'t go wrong.  Spend the extra couple of bucks for the real deal.  Don\\'t be fooled by a knock off, slow speed, import. SanDisk is a great brand.. never had a complaint. Is working fine in my Galaxy Tab 3 .. would recommend I bought this for my galaxy cell phone and I love having the extra space fro music and large picture files. I liked the color; liked that I didn\\'t have to worry about it getting confused with other microSD cards that I had lying around.  It functions as I expected, given that it was made by SanDisk It\\'s a fast card, reliable, and it offers tons more space for my Nook HD. Solid buy that you won\\'t regret. card worked automatically and immediately in Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition tablet.  Transfer fast and faultless thus far.  Previous reports of issues with sandisk memory cards not working on some samsung/android devices concerned me but this doesn\\'t seem to occur with the newer XC versions. I just called Sandisk and they say they have a new card version that corrects the problem. 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)Sandisk Tech says that the new package will show that the card is made after March, 2013 (don\\'t know if that includes March, but probably does), and it should be corrected. Some older than late 2012 reportedly are ok.  Who knows.They even say that they will provide a free UPS return label.Of course, you are taking a risk as to whether the problem is really fixed, so keep backups.  I don\\'t know what I would do. Fast card while it worked.  Died less than a week after return period expired....  Must note though that that is the nature of any memory storage card or drive.  Some fail, some last forever.  Not SanDisk\\'s fault, not amazons fault - it is what it is.  BUT it is for this reason that i think Amazon should extend the return period on items which fall into this category.  Dont worry amazon, i still love you - but feel like your played the role of a proctologist on this one... I bought this for my garmin virb action cam.  It will store 6-7 hours of video, which is great because that\\'s all my batteries will record.  It\\'s fast and big, what more can you want! I use it in my Samsung Glaxy S3 to increase more GB. The device has 16 GB, now increase to 48 GB. It performs very well & bought at good price. Works great on my S3 with no problems. i used before on my Samsung Epic but the phone had trouble using it , kept getting &#34;sd card suddenly removed&#34;  notification. What more can I say?I\\'m using it to double the memory of my Asus TF700 (from 32 to 64Gb) and this card has a good read/write performance and it\\'s SanDisk!Recommended. been using it for about a year now with no issues. come on amazon, how much more can i put on this review? it\\'s a memory card. popped it in, formatted, works fine....be sure and power down first, i didnt and it didnt like it, had to reboot anyway. I bought this micro SD card for my Galaxy Note 2 about 5 months ago and its been great. Plug and play with no problems. It recognized it immediate and right after I was able to transfer 20gb of videos/music to my phone right away. The transfer speed is good and is what I was expecting from reading guides on these type of SD cards. This is a good product and I recommend it to anyone looking for a SD card. I placed the SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card without the  Adapter in my Samsung HMX W200 Camcorder and it works great! Used with my GoPro Hero 3 black edition and it works like a charm! It comes with the adaptor to use in a regular SD card slot, or can be read with any microSD card reader with no issues.  Pushing video, even high quality, high frame rate video to this card is flawless. It\\'s amazing to think that I need the space, but I do, and 32 GB is nice. Love not having to worry about needing more space on my phone...yet. I use this in my Go Pro. Never had an issue with it recording 1080p video it doesn\\'t skip a beat.  It\\'s hard to beat any of the prices on sd cards on amazon this is always the first place I check. Popped in my Galaxy S5. Works.Disk came with an enclosure to be used when inserting into PCs, laptops, and other devices.Shipping was fast. I bought it for my new galaxy note and I realized the device didn\\'t recognize it...tried it on other devices, laptops, desktop, macbook didn\\'t work...Very disappointed ! This little microSDHC memory card from SanDisk is equal to their reputation. It is fast enough and large enough to store and stream full length movies that we\\'ve ripped from our own DVD collection. This is a perfect addition to our new smartphones. We bought three of these for our recently purchased smartphones.Highly recommended by me. The disk keeps up with the data input, it\\'s neat and compact, it responds to the computer readily. I really like it. Might get another one and I\\'d recommend it to a friend anytime. Use it in my tablet pc as extra drive it has great speeds verse some cheaper brands. Nothing else really to say SanDisk makes quality products and you can count on them at a small price than the competition. Again, why pay more for the same thing when this fits the bill for your needs. Save your extra money or give it to a needy family member....We recommend this product with an A+ rating. I bought it to have extra storage on my Samsung tablet. If anyone wonders in which direction you place it in the black side is on the back, while the red and gray side face the front screen. Aldo works great on my canon dslr with the adapter. Brand new card working perfectly good.  Using it with my action cameras: Gopro Hero3 and Contour GPS.  No problem so far! I bought this for my new Gopro3 black. It works wonderfully! I totally recommend it if you\\'re looking for some high quality and speed Put this in the Samsung S5.  Works great.  stores lots of pictures and is easy to load and unload. you can also download the pictures to your computer easily. Got this for my new Galaxy S3. It works great. Tripled my memory and it\\'s compatible! Worth every cent to be able to carry a TON of music and podcasts. Bought this micro sd card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and it works flawlessly. Lots of space and fast! From what I\\'ve seen, this memory seems to have the best stats for transfer speeds and whatnot, but I\\'ll let you do that research on your own, as far as the rest is concerned.Pros:The packaging was plenty to protect the product.Came with the adapter to the full size SD card (most of them do, but this is definitely nice)The price beat those that I could find locally.Cons:none really that I can think of. Great price (at the time i purchased it) - sanDisk is known for making great memory cards - use it,in my GoPro I ordered this for use in my SGH-I337, it was delivered in 3 days and I have had no problems with it so far. I would have to say this was a great buy for the price and I would suggest it for use in any high end smartphone. I\\'ve used this in an assortment of phones and other devices and it works flawlessly and has good transfer speeds, not once have I ever had a problem with this card or any of the many Sandisk cards I\\'ve used, I will keep using this brand as it hasn\\'t failed me yet and great little devices like this one make my life easier. I bought this memory card to replace a 4gb memory card in a ZTE valey phoneand it works great. Many devices still don\\'t work well with 64GB capacity cards. These 32GB cards are often available on sell for a great price and work fantastically. Swapped this into my GoPro and put the 32gb card from there into my S4. In both cases I\\'m completely satisfied with the cards. this card is great and at 20 bucks its a steal. The card handles high transfer speeds which is good for music, pictures and videos. Do not get any lag or have to wait for card to load up. This card was dead on arrival and did not work whatsoever. When copying files to it, the transfer speed was below 1MB/s and then when I would eject the card the contents I just transferred would be lost. The card refused to format, I got an error message that the lock was on when it was not. Definitely a dud. I exchanged for a Kingston card of the same size which worked and still works flawlessly. Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  Install it and forget about it.  I\\'ve never had a problem with it. I purchased this product specifically to utilize it for my Sony Action Cam\\'s.  The SanDisk product works well with it.  I have and not problems whatsoever.  I would recommend  this product for use with the Sony Action Cam or any camera requiring a Micro SDHC card. Works like a memory card should work.  Saves stuff, deletes stuff, transfers stuff, and its just good for lots of stuff.  No problems so far. I used this Memory Card to Expand the Memory in my Smartphone. It worked as expected and was easy to setup. I copied the Stuff from my older MicroSD Card to my computer, changed cards, gave it a couple of minutes to Initialize, and copied the stuff back... Worked great. It\\'s fast fast fast, and big big big.  It\\'s exactly what you need to record all of your ill-advised shenanigans with your friends. Awesome storage. So much space. You just have to format it to the correct format for a phone. and walla you have a ton of space. I have this in my LG Optimus F3 cell phone and I can\\'t believe how fast the file transfer is.  I can take pictures on this card as quickly as I can click the shutter button.  I am very happy with the card and the price I paid for it. Very fast reading and writing for my samsung galaxy s4 from verizon. Highly recommended. Sandisk is numero uno for smartphones. I have purchased two of these. They are cheap enough to buy so you get the fastest on the market. Then you don\\'t have to worry about running out of space, so fast. SanDisk are very reliable as a whole. We have 4 of the 32GB cards in our cell phones and love them.  They offer plenty of room for pix, music, and videos and are fast to save and load from..  Someday, when I get my desired tablet PC, I will be getting another one of these for it! 64GB... I\\'m set for I don\\'t know how long. I bought one for my Note 8 and my S3. I\\'ve loaded tons of pics and music and still have more than enough space to last me for a long, long, long time.Thank you Samsung for having your new devices able to read 64GB microSD cards. I don\\'t notice any significant performance increase over the less expensive class 4 sandisk sd card.  I don\\'t recommend this card. This microSD card is perfect, I\\'m using this on my Sony DSC-TX200V Cyber-Shot and it works the camera took few second to format card and it was ready to stored pictures and video excellent. The costumer service they help me by replacing my card that broke by sending me a new one and it came super fast the card, I will definitely recommend this card and happy that the costumer service they answer me quick and they werer fast. I will definitely buy from this guys. Thanks... I bought it for a Samsung s3 and had continuous problems of messages saying it wasn\\'t connected, etc.  Replaced it wit the equivalent Trascend and never had a problem for the past several months.  It would work on a PC with ana adapater and then failed to format in any device so I had to RMA given the lifetime guarantee.  A hassle. This is exactly what I need.Plenty space for just about anything.Works on computers/laptops, PSPs w/adapter, cameras, camcorders, etc. It\\'s fast, its small, its pretty cheap.  I put one in a usb reader to use as a thumb drive. Use this all the time in the GoPro. It\\'s a great buy! Super cool that it comes with a SD adapter too! Hard to rate a memory hard in very many words. This memory card does what it suppose to do and I haven\\'t had any problems. I had an HTC EVO DESIGN 4G and I added this card to it. It was like 4x faster to transfer files to it from a computer and games like N.O.V.A. 2 which put a massive amount of files on your microSD loads so much faster. I put ALL my apps on my SD and noticed no difference in performance of the games or apps.I had one problem though, and it was that my phone would repeatedly say that the card was unmounted or it couldn\\'t find the card. Popping of the battery cover and pulling out the card and reinserting would fix this, or just a reboot. I thought this was the fault of the card, but since I have upgraded to an HTC EVO 4G LTE, I have had no Issues with the card.So, If you have issues with your phone not reading the card, IT MIGHT BE YOUR PHONE. this is the minimum speed class you want for video recording. there are faster ones, but this does the job and the value is good. make sure to check and see if the camera you are putting this in can take a card of this capacity. seems odd but some don\\'t use a card of more than 32GB, so check first. also check web sites for firmware updates. many cameras did not take these at first but do now. what more can you say about a commodity like memory, get it and store stuff like crazy. to be fair at 1080p this will hold an insane amount of video and images, more than you are likely to shoot on a 2 week trip, but you can always use the extra space as storage and maybe this format will work in your new 4k camera; you will need 65GB then for sure... It is all you can expected for a 32GB SD card. I never tested the read/write speed but it never had a problem for music and videos. This memory card has been working flawlessly. Prices have been dropping nicely. Amazing the storage capacity in something so small. Easy install in to the S4 and expansion of memory was completed with out issue.  Product works as it is advertised. Good priced memory comes in plain white wrapper and an adaptor for SD card size. It didn\\'t forget what I put on it so I guess it works. Got this for my sweetie. Her tablet has 32 on board. She likes books and this will hold a lot. That and the quality and price are great. The memory is fine but the adapter that it came with was useless.  I did not contact the seller about it since I had another to use. SanDisk Ultra 64 GB class 10 used as extra storage space for Surface RT. Everything worked as expected. Well worth the money. This item works great with the Garmin Dash Cam 10 and Garmin hand held topographic GPS. Good value/deal for the money. I would recommend this memory card to anyone that has a  cell phone, or a tablet pc.  This memory card is fast and efficient. I placed this memory card in my Bluetooth speaker, I then loaded it up with different genders of music and it plays beatifully. My Samsung Galaxy S4 now has 119GB of fast microSDXC flash card storage available. At Amazon\\'s rather amazing price, it works out to 94 cents a Gigabyte. Way back when, in the early days of hard drive storage, I paid as much as $500 per Megabyte!This little hummer is fast. The package and ads claim read speeds up to 30 MB/s. My own CrystalMark tests indicate 33.77 MB/s Read and 28.80 MB/s Write.With storage capacity like this and continuing software development, the smartphone and small tablet just might be the future of computing.My initial impression is simple one of awe: 119GB of usable storage in a chip not even the size of my thumbnail.If you have a device that will support microSDXC cards, buy one of these. You can never have too much storage, but you will definitely be hard-pressed to fill this card up with your personally useful data.Great device - great buy.Jerry SanDisk 16gb sd card. Does it\\'s job the way it\\'s supposed to. I use it in my tablet and have zero complaints. Quickly went bad. I used it for maybe 2 weeks. Better keep your receipt. Too bad i didn\\'t.Bad deal. period. It is so painful when you just buy that new gadget and a new and better one comes along, bummer. But this great  little card helps you keep the envy at bay becuase while they might have the fastest, you can wow them with content: A huge library of Movies, songs and apps right at your fingertips becuase you have this baby in  your phone, buy one as insurance from phone and tablet envy.EnjoyPS format it in your device, this will ensure compatability, in most cases.Update: 4 months later: Still doing its job. Lots of space for apps, music and movies and still happy with my device. No problems or troubles to report. Good product.Enjoy.Jb Great price for a fast large micro sd card!  recieved it super fast too!  Works perfectly with my Droid 4!  Verizon wanted $50 for a class 4 card like this. For the price, this helps speed up my phone significantly by freeing up memory used by the camera and apps. Good case, it is nice that it comes with an SD adapter, fast transfer of pictures, over all good memory card. I tend to hold my reviews until I test things thoroughly. Is 2 years is thorough enough? Works, no issues. stated capacity, good speeds. Turns my smartphone into an iPod effectively! You can store music, pictures, videos and more on it. It can be accessed directly with an adapter or indirectly via micro USB to USB (2.0, 3.0). Would highly recommend! Unfortunately this sd card is not fully compatible with the samsung galaxy s2. I installed it and the phone would &#34;check&#34; it only to tell me &#34;SD card ready for removal&#34;. This was a continuous cycle and even after formatting to FAT32, NTFS, and FAT the card would not work and would revert back to exFAT format.I do recommend this product for those who can get it to work but my 3-stars rating is only due to a lack of compatibility listing on the product site. i\\'ve been buying SanDisk for awhile, but I have yet to experience how durable and fast they are until now!when accessing video or photos on my phone, they do not hesitate to load. (all due to the memory card for being highly efficient)and for the price I got them for were amazing!I highly recommend! worked for me and at great Amazon price. In my Hero 2 GoPro\\'s doing video\\'s at least once or twice a week for over months. No problem; it fits and it seems fast.  The colors are a good addition because when it pops out on the floor or something, you can find it. I chose this item because of the speed of the memory and also because of the SanDisk brand and I wasn\\'t disappointed.  The memory works fine in my Motorola Razor-M cell phone allowing me to store movies, pictures, and music that I can play on my phone.  The adapter, on the other hand, feels flimsy and fragile.  I had trouble inserting it into two different readers and even then it felt like like it was going to break.  I have several other adapters and this adapter feels like the material is much thinner than the others.  Having said that, I didn\\'t purchase the memory for the adapter I purchased it for the speed rating and compatibility.  All things being equal I would consider purchasing the memory again. Bought one for each cellphone. Will never have to worry about download space for pictures or apps or anything else. Does what it is supposed to when it is supposed to. Reads at 30 writes at 8-10. Perfect peripheral for my GS3. I put 20 GB of videos on this micro SD card and  it is a perfect fit and functions flawlessly. Pros and consPros1. It\\'s fast2. It works in my Galaxy Note 3 (also works in my gf\\'s Galaxy Note 2 and my brother\\'s Galaxy S4)3. I got it on sale. Sales rock.4. It\\'s half red, which makes it harder to lose than all-black ones.5. Comes with a MicroSD-to-SD converter so you can use it in stuff like cameras and SD card slots on your computer. Wildly useful for non-phone transfers and uses.Cons1. None yet. We\\'ll have to see how long it lasts. This is the second one I have purchased from Amazon and I have had great service from the first one I bought 6 months ago.  It is fast and fits perfectly in MS Surface computers. I have exclusively used Sandisk Extreme cards in my pro photography gear for years and they have NEVER let me down. This one is a dud, though. I plugged it in, let my phone format it, and then start copying to it. Everything copied just fine, but after I got done, that\\'s when it started acting up.If I had my phone plugged into the computer and was using it as a storage device, I got tons of CRC errors and/or messages saying that I needed to format the card before using it. The phone would come up from time to time saying that I had inserted a blank card. If I reboot the phone, it works fine for a little bit, and the errors would start again. I thought maybe it was the way the phone formatted, so I tried to format it on the computer, but that didn\\'t help anything.Very frustrating! Thankfully I\\'ve had it for 2 days before the trouble started, so it\\'s going back to Amazon for a refund and I\\'ll have to find a more reliable card for my phone. The card worked great at first. I\\'ve never had a problem with Sandisk in the past but I bought this card for my Galaxy S3 back in October and it was dead by December. I\\'m sorely disappointed by this purchase. Maybe it\\'s just a faulty card but my experience was terrible so this gets one star. never looked to verify the capacity of this card, it is clearly labeled 64gb but when installed it clearly is not. When installed into any computer it shows 27.4gb available with 1.68 used. So beware if you order one to make sure you are getting what you pay for. My wife\\'s 4 GB microSD card failed on her phone.  So in order to prevent any issues I got one for her phone and one for my phone.  We were able to transfer our photos and music over on to these cards with plenty of room to spare. We bought this card to use in a Samsung Tab 2 7&#34;, since it came with only 8gb of storage  only about 4gb left after all the junk and bloatware it comes with.  We found out we couldn\\'t delete the extra, unneeded apps without messing up the system.  With the 32gb card, we hope to not need anymore storage for the foreseeable future.  The card was immediately recognized by the system and is intergrated seemlessly.  Being able to use additional memory storage was one reason we got the Samsung instead of the Apple products. Perfect counterpart for the Microsoft Surface RT tablet. Supports Bitlocker encryption so you can keep it password encrypted in case you lose it. I have no issues playing HD videos from it using the Windows 8 default video player. I purchased this card to double my disk space for my MS Surface RT. The price was right and I am happy with my purchase. I would recommend this card to anyone needing a 32GB MicroSD card. tested the SD card speed through the play store app, gets the speeds advertised and allows me to download more tv shows for my trips! perfect This puts me at about 80 GB on my phone.  I will be purchasing more of these as needed for other devices. I reformatted to FAT32, transferred all the files from my old phone, put this in my Galaxy S3, and have hardly thought about it since. It\\'s huge and just works reliably. superb quality!seems to never gets full..got it sooner than expected..did my research before making my move and i was sold with sandisk It is very fast and very, very practical! I really like, almost able to use, and in my phone can play full HD, only great! It\\'s a nice product, worked perfectly with Windows 7. However, it doesn\\'t quite work when placed inside my AT&T Samsung Galaxy S3. Files copied into it are NOT shown in the S3\\'s file browser. Googled a bit for this problem, and I concluded it\\'s my phone\\'s problem. This card works great, it has lots of space and great transfer speeds.  It shipped quickly and the package was in great shape. I bought this memory card for my dashcam and it works perfectly.  I have no problems with it\\'s write speed or resolution of video.  You can trust SanDisk for a quality product as I have many in use and have had no failures yet. Great addition to my phone, came with SD card converter so I was able to transfer data from my old card using my laptop. Have had no issues and I love all the extra space available for photos and videos. This is an SD card.  Nothing exciting, except when they don\\'t work, I suppose... but this thing worked perfectly.  I put it in my VivoTab Windows 8.1 device, and it worked perfectly.  It has about 59GB of formatted free space on it... typical, but most folks expect to get to use the full 64GB... I heartily recommend this device!!! I started useing it the minute I got it, transferred 30g from my old SD card to the new 64g Micro Card with no problem.  Arrived on time and packaged well. Fast transfers.  I was hesitant to buy a larger micro storage, thinking that it would be easy to damage.  This storage fits the phone perfect, and I wouldn\\'t hesitate to buy again. Unerstand that these cards may come in different formats.  I had to reformat on a Windows XP machine after finding a HP utility via Google to get this to work properly in my SAMSUNG Galaxy Note 2. I mounted the SanDisk Ultra 64GB MicroSDXC card in a Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet as a data drive.  The card was instantly recognized by the tablet, and there is no apparent delay with read/write operations.The card (I ordered the \\'easy open\\' package) came with an SD adapter that allows the card to be used as a \\'regular size\\' SD card.Recommended. I bought it for a Tablet. I like having the capacity for music movies and files. I have purchased this model before and never had a problem I bought this to replace the 32GB microSD I had in my phone that up and died on me.  This one is still kicking, so I guess that\\'s a good thing.  It\\'s been about 6 months and all is good. I bought this to upgrade my phone micro SD, works great and lots of storage. I have not been able to test the speed of the transfer as google has chosen to turn against their customers and disable any ability to connect phones to PCs in a normal since. I have seen this other places and they can&#8217;t beat the price it has saved from using up my main hard drive makes it a 96 instead of 28 which it came with I use this for my family - 3 Samsung Flight II phones.  We have not experienced any problems.  The kids take a lot of pictures with their phone. Super fast, tons of room. Who wouldn\\'t love this micro SD card? The price is even great. I\\'ve been using it on my phone for about 6 months now and I\\'ve had zero problems. It sped up the processing time of my camera app considerably. There are lots of SD memory cards on the market today, that are cheaper. I have always used San Disk, they never fail. Fast reliable good solid performance for your digital camera. You cannot go wrong with San Disk. I\\'ll never need another/bigger Memory Card.  It\\'s fast, plugs right in. It didn\\'t need any setup etc..  SanDisk is a quality brand. I use this in a D-Link web cam and it is fast read/write and reliable SanDisk are the best! I have tried other brands but always fall back on SanDIsk! Sandisk class 10 as far as memory cards to me is the best! As for the price of $20+ this card is all you need for advance cameras phones ext. I bought it for my Go Pro Black edition and it worked flawlessly without and buffering error. For my money Sandisk is where I would put my money on before any other memory card... Already many reviews on the product so i just wanted to say i have a few of them and these cards are just plain solid and priced right as well. Hope to see the 128 gb soon. This works just as advertised.  I have had no problems at all and works great in my new GoPro Silver edition. its 64 gigs it works great not sure what else to say about it really. Not much else to say. This is an amazing memory chip card. At less than half the size of a regular postage stamp, this card fits my Garmin GPS and allows me to take oodles of photos along for viewing. AND, it comes with an adapter to allow using it in my PC with one of the many multi-card readers. 32 Gigabytes in such a tiny card and at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended. Purchased for use in a dash-camera. Have been using for 2.5 months now without any issues. Not sure what else to say about it, hopefully I get a couple years worth of use out of it. good with low pricethankssandisk ulttra i used it for my dash cam. and its works. i can record unto 32g but as user i regularly formatting 1or 2 times amonths to keep memory in a good conditionthanks I use this in my Hisense Sero 7 Pro and it works great. It\\'s a good buy for any device works great does what it says it will do. price has come down over the years and quality has improved. I use it in my note 3 and it does a great job. when I fill it up I put everything on an external hard drive and the card can be used over and over and over again. Picked up a couple 32gb cards only because the 64gb cards are still expensive and or out of stock (I try to buy only from Amazon directly or fullfilled by amazon for faster shipping).  I have many many SanDisk cards from microSD (in our smart phones), SDHC in our point and shoots and surveillance cameras, and compact flash cards for my 5D. Nothing really to say, except for excellent memory, fast and efficient. Can\\'t go wrong with Sandisk. Using it for my Acer Iconia Tab, works like a charm. Thanks. This was pretty awesome and cheap, I had just bought my Galaxy S4 and figured I\\'d upgrade my sd card from the 32 I had, its nice to have since the s4 inexplicably has almost no internal storage, still awesome phone though, but we\\'re not talking about that today. I bought this MicroSDXC card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition and it works great.  The transfer speeds on it are excellent.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Bought this for my Samsung Tab3.  Works great, fast and have not had a problem.  This will also work with the Samsung Galaxy S4. This is the fastest MicroSDHC I\\'ve used.  I got it for a tablet but it turned out the tablet had no MicroSDHC slot when it arrived.  So, using it for a 10.1MP camera.  It writes very quickly and then off to the next shot.  I\\'m quite pleased with the performance of this card.I think there may be cards even faster.  But this suits my needs of casual photography. Very good product that I am using with my smart phone. As usual, Amazon packageing was acceptable and it didn\\'t take forever to open as some packages seem to take. My previous card was a Sandisk 32gb class 4 card. This card\\'s speed is about 3x faster! Now I can put more music and movies to my hearts content! The only thing about this that I can say is a \"negative\" is that in order for my HTC Sensation 4g to recognize it, I had to reformat the card, even though the packaging says it\\'s Android compatible. It even has the mighty green Andy the Android on it! LOL But after formatting the card in windows 7, I was able to use it in my phone. I didn\\'t use the fat32 utilities so I cannot remark about those formatting procedures.Oh and I forgot to add the first card that was sent didn\\'t work at all. The card didn\\'t try to format. Amazon sent me one overnight without charge! Well I had to return the bad one of course, but the process couldn\\'t be easier. The card was actually backordered a few weeks because of the deal of the day Amazon had on the card, which I purchased under as well...This card is authentic, came in Sandisk packaging and is indeed a CLASS 10 card. Purchased for use as add-on memory for Motorola RAZR Maxx Phone.  Works great.  Package arrived as scheduled.  All is good. I use it on my phone, it works well enough. Android doesn\\'t like to use the card by default, so I have to move things manually, but that\\'s beside the point. The card works well. Just put this memory card into my S3, formatted it from the storage menu on the S3, then downloaded the Sandisk Memory Zone app from the Google Playstore on my phone.  If I have issues with this memory card I\\'ll come back here to update this review but so far so good! No problems yet, works fine in htc sensation, it seems kinda slow but I\\'m thinking it\\'s a problem with my phone interface not the card itself If you\\'re looking for extra storage for your device, this is it. You can store pics, songs and so much more. i got it to expand the memory on my galaxy note 2.  love it. can hold almost a whole years worth of pictures and videos and other docs.  if my phone took a larger one, i\\'d get that one too. What can i say its a micro SD.  It serves its purpose and it works just so.  I would recommend to others The sandisk ultra 32 gb is very fast. The quiality is excellent. Usefull for all device. Not problem. I recomended. Solid card, used for music on phone and apps, but has been standing in on my DSLR and has functioned great for the purpose. Got the card at $20, which was a bargain, and it\\'s finally full. SanDisk provides dependable storage for my new tablet. SanDisk is what I rely on for my phone and computers.  Has never let me down. Anybody getting this 64 GB card be aware that this card before use  needs to be formatted. The problem is that computers only format 32 GB or less ( I got only 28 GB formatted)  of the card. SanDisk don\\'t tell that to nobody. So what\\'s the use to buy such expensive card when you can only use 32 GB instead of the 64. You can Google it and discover that other people had the same problem. I wish i knew.I bought it to put it on my Galaxy Note 2 android phone. I think they shouldn\\'t even sell the 64 GB or at least informed the people. I heard that there are applications that could make it work but when i buy something I expect that to work without the need of hassling around since i\\'m not a geek. 6 months later and no problems. It\\'s a very solid product and I\\'m very happy with it. Would order again. When I opened the micro disc and adapter I did\\'t know what to do with them. I went to UTube on installing them, and all became clear. The micro fits into the top of the adapter and then the whole thing fits into my camera. Very neat and high powered. This super-speed card works great in my phone. I haven\\'t had any problems with it since I bought the thing! I\\'m certainly able to record HD video right onto the card no problem. I recommend this for those who need quick data delivery to and from there external card. I recommend it! hello,we have been using sandisk memory cards since the beginning of sd cards.  this latest version was recommended for my samsung galaxy 4s phone.  with the zillion photos, videos and apps, the original 16/13gb of space was becoming full and not saving due to \"lack of space.\"  so, the sandisk micro sd card was the answer.  pop the back off easily on the phone, slip the mini sd card into the provided slot, make sure it \"clicks\" in and put the phone cover back on the unit.  it is as simple as that.  now, i have 32 gb of extra space and my new phone stores anything i want to store.  (i constantly make backups to my home computer...very easy)  the connection simply shows the phone data and the sd card data when connected to the home computer.  i transferred my largest photo/video file to the sd card.  now the original 12gb is open for more instant quality photos and videos.  when the original card gets loaded again.  13meg camera takes super quality photos and videos, but also takes up a lot of space.adding a micro sd card is less expensive than ordering a 32gb galaxy4s, but yrmv  great productupdate...  the original \"super large\" file that is on the sd card still shows up on the original gallery screen.  it still has the same functions, but my original 16gb shows more room for the next zillion photos, etc. Haven\\'t experienced any problems, arrived really fast. It\\'s a great price for the GB size and was compatible with my android os tablet. Well worth the price! I plus sandisk is a reputable brand I trust. Highly recommended! What can I say. Plugged it in and it worked.Dell Venue 8 tablet.Have always had good luck with SanDisk brand. It\\'s the top end besides the stupid expensive Extreme.  It works fine.  I\\'ve had 4-5.  I\\'d get cheaper ones which I suspect are about as good, but slow or fail isn\\'t worth it to me to save a couple bucks.  This just work, and work fast. Item came as described:  YesItem was priced well:  YesI\\'m using the microSD as an external which is always plugged into my mac.  Helps me store a bunch of files for school, and as a back up. SanDisk is the best brand to get for memory cards. I bought two of these little gems to go with my SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip and they work wonderfully. works great, it\\'s the real deal (not a fake, as one often finds on some websites) - great in the galaxy tablet, and with an adapter, slots easily into my computer. doesn\\'t seems to be some chinese crap... looks like it\\'s the original one... works fine with my galaxy s4 and also with my tablet... 100% recommended... I am using sanDisk SD card for all my devices. Cellphone, Tablet and PC. What can I say, this product is one of the best! I have 2 of these ScanDisk Ultra 32Gb class 10 microSDHC cards.  One for my Acer Iconia A100 Android tablet and one for my Linux laptop to move files around.  I\\'ve formatted both differently to make them fit best for their hosting operating system and both are working great.  No issues and great performance.I can stream 1080p movies from these cards without hiccups.I also used one of these cards in my 1080p camera and had no issue whatsoever keeping up with writing speed.Great card. Maximize your storage now with this product. Installed easily, even for tablet new-bees. The tablet recognized it-no problem. And I\\'m pretty techno challenged, but have used it for picture storage and successful transferring data from the device. Got this 32GB card for my Droid Razr Maxx HD.  It was recognized by the phone and I have had no troubles with it. Shipping was only a couple of days. I bough it because it said it was fast, but not. I\\'m only getting 13Mb/s with an Galaxy Note II a very fast an excellent phone. Installed this in an LG smartphone without incident and it has been working without as hitch ever since.  More words cannot express my lack of emotion for it, but they do make the review long enough to qualify. Using this for a dash camera we purchased for the car.  It\\'s doing the job - recording the audio and video just fine. Good price, excellent for my camcorder. The micro design was not required for my unit, but gives you flexibility for cell phones, etc. Good buy great price size and speedyou cannot go wrong with this itemi have bought several of them already in different sizes I had a regular 32GB card that I used with my BlackBerry Torch 9810. It was slow though. I replaced it with this card and I can definitely see the difference in speed on my Z10. Very happy with it! The only thing I had to do was to format the card with my BlackBerry Z10 and that was it. Look how many highly positive reviews this card has; just get this one. It is huge, it is fast and reasonably priced for a such a high-speed chip.BTW, this comes with the filesystem formatted to exFAT.  Depending on your device, it may not like that and you need to format it to FAT32.  The problem is that Windows does not support formatting FAT32 filesystems above 32GB.  So you can format this as FAT32 under Linux or use this tool in Windows [...] SanDisk makes some of the best storage media out there. Also have a couple of flash drives that i love. I\\'ve officially expanded the memory in my Surface Pro 2 by 50%. How amazing is moderity? Literally, my entire life\\'s work can be stored on a device smaller than my thumbnail. Great. Great price, Great function, works in my cannon camera, my Note 3 and I could not be happier with this purchase Excellent card that I use primarily in my carcam. Has also been used, and been compatible, in a small digital camera with the camera\\'s proprietary adaptor. I needed a memory upgrade for my phone which is a Galaxy S3. The time I got it was on sale and  it has yet to fail me once. It stores a good amount of media for my device and can hold a number of 1080 movies and full resolution  pictures I have taken. Very handy for those long distance trips. Why is you buy a 16GB card and when you install it, you have only 14.8 GB? Exactly where does that 1GB+ I PAID FOR...go to? I am using this item to extend the Memory Capacity on the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet. Very good price with free shipping(Order &#62;$35) and it works as advertised! I have this in my phone storing the majority of my MP3 collection (400+ albums). It loaded 30Gs of music comparatively fast. And never seem to have any problems with skipping or stuttering I\\'ve had with slower cards. Probably would be a solid selection for video (I haven\\'t tried it yet) and photos save off quickly allowing follow-up shots I would have missed before. The class ten card failed and jamed my phone a KYOCERA RISE : it was replaced with another regular H D 32GB SanDisk card and is working fine. The micro SDHC CARDS are 1/3 less in price than they used to be and are a best buy by far.Your Music PalJoe Mal Amazon ran a good deal on this 64GB microSDXC, so I jumped on the bandwagon.  When it arrived I snapped a few photographs to test it out and it worked well...until I tried to retrieve the files.  I don\\'t know how, but it became corrupt and no longer would reformat or function in any of my devices.  I exchanged it for a replacement through Amazon and the new one works beyond my initial observations.  Browsing seems much faster than previous SDHC class 10 cards.  Thank you Amazon for your immediate exchange.  highly recommended for today\\'s on the go data storage.  *(original review was 2 stars, but after Amazon\\'s immediate replacement and great customer service I re-rated to 5 stars.) Works as expected! Can\\'t complain about it has plenty of storage for pictures and videos! Will buy again when needed! works great in my ASUS android tablet. the 32GB specification seems to limit the size, but it works great, some I am happy to write more words. I have buy the SDXC for Xperia Arc S even many was saying it support till 32GB SDHC, The SDXC 64GB work perfectly on the Xperia Arc S I used this for a Motorola Droid X for music files. loading the files seem to be a little herky jerky but once on there they played fine. Not sure the problem is with the memory card  or the phone. I am using The Amazon app or the Motorola app that came with the phone. Got this for my new Samsung Galaxy 5.0.I can\\'t understand why someone would buy a Class 4 for only 5 or 6 bucks cheeper than this Class 10 Micro SDHC.VERY fast 30mbs speed.Comes with adapter for PC.Been using San Disc Flash Memory for years with no complaints.If your using an Android device or anything that need fast data transfer this card won\\'t dissapoint!!! This item works exactly as advertised!  Those negative reviews for this product must be from people who mistakenly reviewed the wrong product or don\\'t know what they have.  This SanDisk Ultra 32Gb SDHC micro SD card is truly a class 10, and works fine in my HTC phone! WORKS PERFECT WITH MY SAMSUNG TABLET, VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT, GOOD QUALITY AND AWESOME, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, FAST SHIPMENT, A PLUS works what more can i say . it went down 10 bucks the day after I bout it but whatever.  Great micro SD im so upset right now it just died , turned on my phone and all my movies pics music all gone. card just died after three months bullcrap. Love it, now i have 118GB in my zte supreme, works really well in my phone, it restarted my phone a few times when i first put it in but no problems after that, no idea why it did that, but now i can fit my entire music collection on my android which has reached 94GB of all rock and metal!!!!!!!!!!!! now i can get rid of that damn ugly ass ipod classic!!! Ordered this to go with the tablet I ordered for my fiance. It works well and she loves her tablet! I have no complaints. I wanted a good class-10 microsdhc card, and this does the job. It has no difficulty keeping up with recordings, photos, music, downloads, etc. Finally, a microsd card that doesn\\'t bottleneck my download speed! Hard to review this. It\\'s an amazing little chip with huge capacity and it does what it\\'s supposed to do. 5 stars. and fairly cheap. it is a good microSD fast 64GB memory chip... flexible to be used in everything from just flat memory cards, or cameras, vids, etc... Plug and play!  Stuck it in my phone and within seconds it was ready to go!  Great way to add extra memory for those of us who can use them in our phones! Only been a month or so but best price, quick shipping and MASSIVE storage.  I didn\\'t run speed tests or anything but no issues.  I will edit this review if I have a problem down the road. Loaded 2000 songs on this and still have lots of room left.  It works in both of my cell phones and my mp3 player (Cruise by Sansa). Buy it. I could never commit to paying so much for data until my 32GB filled up so quick. So i wasted money buying the 32GB when in the end i still ended up buying the 64gb. What can I say.. It\\'s a SanDisk.. Adapter works well, fits great in my tablet, 32 GB is a lot of space! This card is fast, fast, fast. it also holds more photos and videos than I have been able to take thus far. However, as the number of such items increases, I can see that I will, relatively soon, be looking for a 128 or 256 gb card. Very satisfied with this purchase. So far so good. Fit right into the slot on my Samsung S5 I bought this card for use with my Asus Transformer Book T-100TA to add external and removable/replaceable storage capacity.  When inserted into the slot provided it was immediately recognized and the driver installed.  The card appears as available and with the promised storage capacity in the &#34;MY PC&#34; folder of the computer.  I have been able to move files on and off the card as intended.  The product is fine and the price was satisfactory. Price was great, Delivery was on time, now I have plenty on storage in my Gopro Hero 3, The SD card adapters makes things much easier to transfer files to my other devices. the site is very reasonably priced unit memory added to my Samsung galaxy no pro-12.2, 64 GB. It also helped expand the memory in this to allow for better storage of songs, information, and I believe it to be a good value. Got this for a Galaxy S4 and it worked flawlessly.  Typical SDHC installation with no issues that increased S4 storage capacity. Works well in my GoPro even though it wasn\\'t one of the GoPro recommended ones.  A good buy that has the speed for movies and big pictures. Does everything its supposed to do.  Haven\\'t been able to really test speed in a video camera to see if its really Class 10.  Given its from SanDisk I expect everything is good.  Great price. I bought this for my new Samsung G5. I installed it and the card was immediately recognized. It should be big enough for lots of music and videos. I got this for my Samsung Galaxy tablet. According to Samsung, the tablet can only take a 32 GB card. But other reviewers of the tablet said it could take 64 GB. I went ahead and bought the 64 GB one and it formatted fine in my tablet. great product.  I use san disk ultra 64 GB on all of my tablets,  I would highly recommend these to all of my friends Got this very fast from Amazon and its fast glitch free performance for any smart phone or tablet - Ive used it in both and whereas I thought my atrix 2 was glitchy this solved the problem with hanging up screens and slow access to music and syncing. THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT AND WAS A REASONABLE ENOUGH PRICE. I AM GOING TO BUY A LARGER ONE NEXT TIME. BEST CHK OUT THE SIZE YOU CAN USE IN YOUR PRODUCT BEFORE BUYING. Good deal at a great price.  It is sturdy and has over 31 GB after its format. I\\'ll be getting another. I have used these Sandisk Ultra Micro SDHC 16 GB cards exclusively since buying POV cameras that  require them. I have used them in Gopro Hero 3 and Sony Action Cameras.These cards are great. SanDisk Ultra disks are great for additional storage in a cellphone or with an adapter in a camera to save photos and music. I needed extra storage in my Garmin for additional topo maps and routes, and this card fits the bill. It comes with a standard SDHC adapter, as most microSDHC cards do. Plenty of space for extra files on the GPS. Satisified with the purchase. Even the website ([...] had this card in the picture of what i\\'d be ordering. When i got a plain black sandisk card i was a bit concernes, and peeved sonsidering i bought the big one. Turns out android HATE class 10 cards and much more prefers Class 4 cards because of the way the OS accesses LOTS of files at once, and Class 4 timing is just better for their computations. Only the 1 star off because of my own expectations.Otherwise this is gonna make a great camera card, hopefully the pics take faster (it\\'s certainly a size upgrade atleast!). Fits in my Samsung Galaxy S3. Migrated all of my music to my phone and no issues. Fast and good performance. Just annoyed I lost so much space after formating it. Fits my Galaxy SIII and gives me lots of storage :] Should be just the thing that I was looking for I had a cheap 8 GB SDHC card that just would not behave itself in my Android phone and kept throwing errors and becoming corrupt. I looked into getting the 64 GB Sandisk Ultra, but read about all the problems on the XDA forums that people were having and went with the 32. I wish I had a 64 GB capacity to be honest with the rate at which my SGS3\\'s camera can suck up storage, but it\\'s sufficient, and most important, extremely fast and reliable. I\\'ve never had an error and never had to format it. Plugged it in and it was ready to go. You get what you pay for. I like it for using on my cell phone. If used on Camera, it is slower then the &#34;Extreme&#34; version. not a bad prices and really adds the needed storage.  I added to Win8.1 and android tablet.  No problems. Plug and go. only can use 29g after formatted butwhat can you do, i still like it for my psp, works great fast! I was really excited when this came out I have a Mac Air and a lot of music and film on it so the ability to stick this in my MiniDrive was great, it was that or buy a 128GB MiniDrive Air which is like $30 more that this and I already had a MiniDrive.  Problem is its not very fast, not fast enough, my girlfriend has a new 128GB MiniDrive and it runs way faster than this in my old adapter and new sandisk 128.  Its great though 128gb in this little chip glad its out cause now its just a matter of time before they make it better.Thanks I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Work Pro 12.2 Tablet. It woks so what else can you say? I have only had this for about 2 months and it is already dead. My GoPro doesnt see the memory card, my PC doesnt see the memory card, both of my laptops do not see it. A no brainer here.  Copied the data off the old 16gb microsd, swapped the cards, put the data back on, and \\'voila!\\'  Space constraints relieved! Works as described, good packaging, fair price, and i have no issues with the product up to this point.  thanks. I bought this Micro SD card to replace the cheap no-name card I had been using in my Nextboox tablet for the last six months or so.  When the Brand X card suddenly stopped working, I opted to spring for the extra $$ and buy a branded replacement.  So far, everything is working fine.  I hope I am not disappointed six months from now and have to replace this one, too. I purchase three of these and they work great, and were almost half the local price. If you need a reliable high speed micro sd card, this is for you. purchased to use in a dash cam system. works perfectly. no skips or corruption of files on the recorder. highly reccomended. Works fine on my android phone..seems fast when transferring from the computer..but with could be faster still..don\\'t know if there is anything faster..so I am happy with it..would recommend This card is great for the money and performs adequately. I recommend this product to anyone who needs a memory card. Put this in my cell phone and loaded it up. It works like a charm and have had no problems what so ever with it. It worked right out of the box. I would buy another one if needed. I bought two of these from a major electronics retailer to make sure I don\\'t get a bootleg one and they both crapped out on me. I usually buy from amazon but I needed them rig away . So unless that company has bought a large batch of bootleg cards or maybe I\\'m retarded. I bought them from the same store but different locations. I have switched brands now. Not taking anymore chances just in case a flood of bootleg ones hit the retail chains too. It worked fine at first but as the card filled up both times, both times they died and my pc or phone couldn\\'t reformat it or recognize it. Good luck if you buy this major name brand, I thought they were the best too but not for me I guess. Can\\'t go wrong with s SanDisk product. Love it. Bought it to expand the memory on my Samsung Galaxy S3 - At&T. So far, no issues, no lag while playing videos. All i can say for now since i have yet to use them is, they showed up on time very fast, as well each came wrapped in a small paper packet that is small enough to fit in your pocket. Secondly If these are the right ones i believe they will be excellent since based on the info and exp. i know from other ones i have used. I got them as gifts for other people so i have not had a chance to notice much. Hope this helped. I bought this to store all my music on my phone, but it doesn\\'t work. The phone has trouble reading from the card, and I keep having to reformat it. Buy one from Sony or some other company instead, especially if you have a GS3 What can one say about San Disk other than it works and keeps working.  Works well with or without adaptor. I can\\'t believe how much info you can fit on this little card. The transfer speeds are unbelievable. My phone camera is now always in burst mode because it copies the file so quickly. Was working fine for 2 months. Randomly stopped working. Is not recognized by my computer or cell phone. I am beyond the Amazon return window, so this absolutely sucks.Wasted my money. I don\\'t know about the read or write speeds, but the micro sd card seems to work fine with my galaxy s4 and I didn\\'t have to reformat it. when I got my phone I didn\\'t know about 6GB out of the 16GB would not have been available to me from the start because of its operating system and all the software that was pre installed so I used this to get more than enough memory for my phone and it works great I have all my music a few movies and all my pictures and all my ebooks on it Great read and write speed compared to my old Transcend, of course that was a 4 class. and this is a UHS 1. I am very satisfied with the price I got it at, and Sandisk Limited Lifetime warranty.oh yeah I asked for the Original Manufacturers packaging, but I got Amazon\\'s frustration free packaging instead. No big deal though. It is a 32 gb micro flash card.  It was bought for an Optimus Ultimate cell phone.  It works just the way it is supposed too.  It gives me added space for pictures, and comes with the full size adapter. I have purchased and used several SanDisk memory cards and I have never experienced any issues with those cards.  One of my first choices when I am in the market for a memory card Fast transfer rates and great storage at a great price! I love these little micro SD cards and use them in several different devices. I feel that San Disk seems to make the best memory cards. -I can\\'t validate technically but this seems to be fast acess and seems to be problem free. I have confidence that &#34;must have picture&#34; will be captured properly. Works real good in my Galaxy S4 phone and Galaxy tablet. Very good price as it can cost above 60 dollars in retail stores. fast card., and so far, reliable. Reformatted to NTFS with no problem. No problems in a Dell Venue 8 pro. Bought this card for my Xperia V. You would have to format it on the phone before it works as exfat file system is not recognized by the phone. Phone will format it to FAT32 so you would have a limit of 4gb for each file. Once formatted to fat32..my laptop (Sony Vaio S13) didn\\'t recognized the card anymore using the adapter, but using an external card reader/writer (using a Sandisk Imagemate All-in-One USB3.0 reader writer) the card can be read and reformatted again. Also, when connecting the phone via the USB cable to the laptop, the laptop recognizes the fat32 formatted card. Lots of storage now for my phone for all those music and videos :D I can\\'t say anything bad about this product and it was a great price too! I would definitely recommend it. I\\'m not sure what to say other than that this product works as described by the manufacturer and seller of this product. Speed is meh. Size is good no troubles it comes with a full sized sd converter too. I put it into my tablet. I use it to put my music videos and movies on. Works great with my tablet and there is no stalling on the movies or videos. Massive memory boost to my Captivate Glide.Holds all my music, files, etc and i still have 20GB free! O_OTransfer speeds are great!Really worth the price! Good space for the money... put it in my ASUS MemoPad HD7 and I have all kinds of media on it with room to spare! LOVE IT!! Bought this for my Raspberry Pi. Works great, it\\'s fast and reasonably priced, and I have not experienced any issues with it yet. Works perfectly with the transfer of data from my gopro to my laptop! I suggest anyone buy this one because it is good quality This is the second SanDisk micro SD that I\\'ve had to return due to some sort of error.  I am thinking I just have bad luck and hopefully 3rd time is the charm.During the time it was working properly, it seemed to be quick. Was worried about some articles saying to use 2 X 32gb cards instead but this 64gb card worked out fine for me but was scared when the camera got real hot the first time around. Far faster than &#34;stock&#34; memory cards, and plenty of speed to boot.For my usage it is more than enough to cover what I need, sure it may not be the absolute fastest memory card in existence, but at under a dollar a GB, it handles my basic needs with ease. I first tried putting it in my camera, without formatting.  It just said &#34;insert another card&#34;.  I put it into my linux computer, and it output lots of errors in the syslog, and fsck wouldn\\'t work at all, just error\\'ed out, so I couldn\\'t even format it.My windows computer couldn\\'t recognize it either, though it tried to format it.  My phone didn\\'t give any errors, but I wasn\\'t able to really test it there.  (I do wonder if just the mini to standard adapter is the problem, since my phone has a mini slot, and everywhere else that I tried it needed the adapter...Exchanging for a different brand, and I\\'ll see what happens. As stated above, and not a bad price.  Bought this thing in hopes of using it with my Ztpad C93 tablet, and it works like a charm.  The card is very fast for what it is and I have not had any problems with it to date. I purchased four (4) items from amazon and when I opened the box my 32gb memory card was missing. So rating this product is truly impossible I needed  this for my new phone. It works great!SanDisk is a good brand so I didn\\'t hesitate to purchase it. There is nothing to really say but sandisk really does well with providing quality storage technology at an affordable price. This SD works as its supposed, I have it in my phone right now and have had it for months. No issues! I have a couple of these and have had no problems with them at all.  They seem to be fast and supply the full advertised memory capacity. The only drawback that I can assign to these SD cards is the limit of a 5 year warranty unlike Kingston. Use these in my GoPro and T2i Canon Camera (with adapter). They are great cards and having multiple (because of the price) means that if one were to get damaged on a trip, I\\'m not down and out. I\\'ve used Sandisk cards for as long as they have existed. These cards are fast and have the solid quality I expect from Sandisk. Recommend. It works fine with my galaxy note 8.0... it is hard to review now for performance, but the price is good... I think. items like this, they either work or they don\\'t so in that regards, whether it worked or not is about all you can comment on in a review.  For me, it worked just fine and the camera never hit buffering moments that slowed down shooting performance. It\\'s a memory card.  It works great.  What else do I need to say?  SanDisk always makes high quality stuff...I am not worried at all... Works great for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  Just plugged and played.  Didn\\'t have to do anything special.  I would recommend. I needed some space on my phone, bought this, has not given me any problems.It just works really well I\\'m using it on my Sony Xperia Z for 3 months and works without problems.this is a memory card 100% recommended I have many microSD cards like many of you guys might too. It\\'s definitely faster than other microSD cards that i\\'ve used before. I\\'m happy with it. Bought this to use on my HTC EVO 3D, which is supposed to have a maximum cap or 32 gb, however after formatting the card in FAT32 format, the phone will read it, and functions w/out any issues. unlike my old memory cards, even with a power loss I have not experienced any lost pictures or videos. worth the price since when i bought this over a year ago, it was still double the price retail and no one carried it locally. I love this card, its way faster than any other micro sd I have ever owned. I can transfer ROMs like nothing on my Galaxy S4. When I had the old MicroSD that comes with every DROID phones, that use to take for ever.High recommend this one. Not a lot to say about it, it\\'s storage.  I haven\\'t done any speed tests or anything but it definitely works in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and I don\\'t see any performance issues watching videos files stored on it. I BOUGHT THIS FOR A TABLET THAT I BOUGHT (Alldaymall(TM) A70X 7 Inch Android 4.2 4 GB A20 Dual-Core Tablet PC) I WAS SKEPTIAL AT FIRST BUT IT WORKED GREAT FOR MY TABLET AND FOR THE PRICE IT BOOSTED MY MEMORY FROM 4 GB TO 36 GB IN TOTAL GOOD PRODUCT! This card transfers data incredibly quickly!. One can notice the difference between a regular SanDisk memory card and this Ultra version. Great Memory and it was at a price I loved! (Using it for my microsoft surface pro and no problems with it) Well, this card is pretty cool. I received one that says C10 instead of U1 (like this picture).  For what I use it, U1 won\\'t work, so the one I received is C10.  I needed mine for a iON Air Pro camera, and the advertisements that &#34;supposedly&#34; say class10 on the page description, but it says U1 on the card won\\'t work for the camera.I don\\'t know why they don\\'t call it Ultra 1 instead of falsely advertising it as a C10 when it really is a U1.  I was lucky to receive a C10, so it worked out, but it makes it more confusing for the other laymen. I bought this memory card for my GoPro. It does everything it is supposed to. It is fast enough to work with the camera and it is very reliable. Bought 2 of these. One to be used on my Sony PSP 3000 with MicroSD To Memory Stick Pro Duo Adapter and the other on my Samsung Galaxy S4. Works great on both. Enough storage for what i need it for. I bought this memory card because I love to have a lot space in my fhone o or computer and seems to work very well i love it. i recommend this product! This card is fast and flawless. Still have not been able to fill it up, and I do have a lot of music in it. I bought this for my Go Pro and it works as intended. The video records properly with no choppiness or other defects. Works well, and fast, does everything it claims to do.  These sshd items are the best.  You cannot hurt them, and they last forever. Purchased two 32 GBcards  for the two new Samsung S4s in or family.  After using for several weeks no issues at all saving a variety of files - photos and Office documents. I bought these in hopes to replace my standard Sandisk 64gb models for quickness.  I\\'m not saying they are lightning fast, but they are definitely faster than the standard version.  I bought one for each of my phones and my tablets,  They work great.  When the 128gb is available, I will try the faster version of those also. After having my first ever failure of a SD card, a 32GB SanDisk Micro SD card that went from apparently fine to totally corrupted in a matter of minutes, and before I could salvage anything on it. With the refund from Amazon of the 32 GB card I purchased this 64GB Ultra card as the replacement for my phone.After having problems getting the full 64 GB seen as an individual 64 GB and not a partitioned into two 32 GB files on the card, and the secret is to NOT format the card in a computer, format the card IN THE PHONE, then via USB or WiFi you can add back all the content,It is seemingly working great, seems fast with no undo lag when taking burst mode photos and I just hope it will continue to do so. I am much more contentious about backing up though, with Android, Amazon and Google pretty much all your content can be saved online and reinstalled but it takes time and is a big hassle so just backing up to a computer works great for the next \\'just in case\\' time. First off, companies need to mark these right, they consider 1000mb to be 1 gig, when 1 gig is actually 1024 mb.That means you will end up with 62 gb &#60; and in all actuality it will read as 59 gb in your device &#62;other then that this card works awesome. I would highly recommend it!one star lost due to them not knowing how to measure data. 64 GB additional memory for a great low price.  SanDisk provides exceptional quality at an affordable price.  Easy to install. This card is high quality and a great price. It is not made for video but works well for photography and most other applications. Big enough to hold all your photos and songs. I use it as extra storage for my Galaxy Tab and works great. I would recommend it. its Works fine for me, keep the main memory of my cell pone free for OS. A lot of space for pics, music and many other stuffs. Everything transfered over to my new SD card fine, but now my phone will randomly lose the SD card and have to search and re-scan it. Tried another SD card and no problems. Now I can only get a refund since its out of stock.Updated 12/9/12-SD card will not not work. My phone or computer will not read it. Lost everything. I\\'d advise if you are looking to purchase an SD card look at another brand. Yes! Even though it says my review is for the 32gb version it\\'s for the 64gb. Not sure why it says 32gb above.I received this card to use in my 2013 MacBook Air for extra storage. I liked that the speeds were up to 30 MB/s. I figured there would be a little bit of a fudge factor but not this much.While I can consistently get almost 45 MB/s read speeds, the write speeds were only around 10.5 MB/s.I guess you could average these together but I don\\'t think that\\'s really the point. :-)I didn\\'t see a review that dealt with this specifically so hopefully this will help someone else out in the future.Update: Only now did I go back and read the tiny print that \"Write speeds may be slower\". Well, that is obvious now but I think 1/4 of the speed is a lot slower. I bought this to use I\\'m my Galaxy note 10.1 tablet. So far so good. Simple put into microsd slot and began storing data on it its amazing how small these cards are, be careful not to loose it, i have almost a couple of times, i use this in my gopro and it works very good. shipped fast as well. A plus I bought this memory card to use in my dash cam, and I\\'m very happy with how it turned out.It does what it\\'s supposed to and that\\'s it. No complaints. It is great, works fast, and came with full size sd adapter.It clearly pays off to buy the faster version of the SD It\\'s an SD card that works fine and is pretty quick.  Not much else I can say about the product. Bought this for my GoPro Hero 3 and am happy with the storage capacity. When formatted it gives me about 9 hours and 20 minutes of 720p video at 60fps.It\\'s high capacity storage, it transfers quickly enough and was reasonably priced. What more can I say? There is a reason why this memory card has thousands of 5 star ratings. Good price and it works well. Works great in my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.Put the memory cards in and go to storage in the settings.  Click format card and off you go.I have not measured read or write speed but i can tell you i can copy over 1Gb video file in just a few seconds. I am loving it so far.My Samsung Tab loves it too. :DIt seems to be going pretty smoothly. This is a \\'set-it-and-forget-it\\' item. Solid performance without issues. I forgot it is still in my Sony camera, Love it The micro disk fit my Samsung phone perfectly by itself and I was able to use the adapter to fit it to my HP computer to transfer my tunes to my phone. Great product and price. I especially like the &#34;green&#34; packaging. So much easier to access the product and no wasteful plastic. Highly recommend it. I am using this with my Samsung Galaxy S3.It worked fine without any issues.It does come with an adapter for SD readers. After I put this card in my new S4, my camera would hang and just not respond to anything. Some apps also stopped working.  I put in my old 16GB card and everything worked fine. I\\'ve had good luck with SanDisk cards on my cameras, and so far this card for my Android phone is no exception. Fast and no errors, though admittedly I haven\\'t had it very long. I\\'m not sure what to expect from a product like this, over the short term, other than it doesn\\'t fail and is a good price. It has worked well in my tablet without incident. I would buy this again. I upgraded a generic, small micro sd card I had on hand and was using in my GS4.  This card is very fast making for seamless read and write of pictures, video and playback of music stored on the SD card.  It works great which is exactly what I have come to expect from all SanDisk products. Wanted to expand my storage on my Surface tablet, and the price was right.Works as expected, no issues.  I\\'m pleased with my purchase. I dont understand why but I use both micro sd cards and usb and these always seem to work better and last longer. I\\'ve had the card for a month now, and it has given me no issues. The transfer speed is quite good; moving data from my old Class 4 device to this new one was arduous only due to the slower, older device. Any new material that I have to transfer to the phone zips along very fast.Now I have just that much more room for movies and music, which is exactly what I needed! I bought this for my Surface Pro 128 GB. So now I have an additional 64 GB which I use for movies and music etc so I don\\'t use up my 128 GB SSD for that stuff. Works great! SanDisk is always reliable, and I have always been satisfied with their products.  I know what I am getting when I purchase products from them. Very fast for taking full HD videos, and for transfering to the PC. Great quality, zero problems at all. A legit product from SanDisk! It stores data and does a good job at it. What else can you say about something that has become so common place in today\\'s world? I thought buying this directly from amazon would guarantee me an \"authentic\" sandisk.  Honestly, I\\'m not sure if I got an \"authentic\" one or not, but it\\'s failed within 6 months.  Either it\\'s not authentic or sandisk has really dropped the ball on quality.  P.s. it\\'s made in CHINA - if that tells you anything. This is a very fast and reliable microSD card.  I used this on my Galaxy Note 2 and loaded movies and family pictures.  Transfer time is speedy! Sadly I missed the return window by a couple of days.  this card got flaky in my galaxy note 2, a little google research and it appears this is a very well known and widespread issue with these class 10 32gb cards.  Avoid until it\\'s fixed. I have this in my phone, I use it for music and videos.Transfer speeds from my computer to the card are pretty speedy.It works great! Always can trust SanDisk for my memory card needs.  This purchase was because I was considering getting a Samsung Galaxy S3 phone, which only has 16gb memory, but has an internal slot for memory expansion.  However, just had several bad experiences with 3 Samsung Printers at work ~ all of them broke down within a couple of weeks of each other for various reasons, and to get repair and replacement parts is ridiculously expensive.... cheaper for me to go and buy a new printer!  Samsung website is 1500% useless, and tech support is even less knowledgeable than my 4 year old nephew!  Spoke to a good friend who works for AT&T;, who has both S3 and iPhone 5.... and he said, DONT GET THE S3.... so I upgraded to an 64GB iPhone 5.So this memory card has gone to my son for his Galaxy S3.So sorry about the rant, but I hate Samsung..... Arrived today. As always shipping from Amazon is the best.I read the reviews, and decided I would give the SanDisk 64GB MicroSDXC a shot, normally I go with Patriot for all my flash memory.So one thing I read that worried me, was the heat issue. Well I can say that it does run hot.How hot you ask? I can feel it through the back cover of my Samsung Galaxy S3. Not plastic melting hot. But I know it is there.Is that an issue? Maybe? Maybe not! I have never really noticed any of my previous cards getting hot. Sure even some of my USB sticks run hot after a transfer.Is it cause for concern? I honestly don\\'t know, yet.I will use it and see if heat causes any issues. If anyone has had the same problem feel free to comment and tell me what happened or if you contacted SanDisk.I am thinking about calling them and also Samsung to find out what max temperature range is acceptable. As I really don\\'t want to ruin my bad-a$$ new phone.Otherwise this is a lot of space for cheap. Can\\'t complain there. I gave it 5 stars for that reason alone.The heat issue is something else and I wont take a star off just because of that.But I will still be concerned until I have some answers.Thanks for reading. Great price and holds tons of stuff. The class 10 is way faster then any other card I have purchased Despite the Class 10 rating, this card has much slower write speeds than some others and there are numerous examples online of it not being fast enough to work with the high resolution video from the GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition. If you\\'re using that camera, choose one of the cards recommended on their site. I bought two of these for use in my HERO cam. I\\'ve had no problem with these and the video/picture quality is right on. This is a good value. This died so fast and I barely used it.  in fact, I did not even put anything on it and it died.  My pad recognized it for a few weeks, but when I went to put stuff on it, it was dead.Complete garbage, stay away. Larger than move and was a high class.I use this on my S4 and works wonderfully.I store all images on SD take quck second to load but much faster and better than the last SD card i had which was a class 6 I bought this card for my Galaxy S4, but with the included adapter I can also use it in my Canon 6D in a pinch. As it meets UHS-1 spec it can keep up with the cameras buffer.There are plenty of details in these reviews regarding transfer rates, etc so I won\\'t revisit that. I have had no issues with the card overheating, it performs exactly as I expected. The price was also fantastic.I would recommend this card to anyone for a wide variety of reasons. It is fast, has a good warranty and comes with the adapter to use in regular sized SD card slots. Picked this up for my Sport Action camera and it\\'s just what I needed. Class 10 and the speeds match up with the rating. Came with a SD card adapter which was a nice bonus. Been using it for almost 2 months now with formatting after each filming. No lag on any of the video, no problems with card, running strong. I couldn\\'t put any files onto the card that were &#62;5 Gb. A little disappointing since I wanted to store movies on it, but I guess it\\'s a limitation of the MicroSD HC technology. Great value for the price.  Comes with an adaptor so it can be used in multiple types of devices.  I have had no issues with it and would recommend it. I got this so I made sure my new smart phone had enough storage. I, unknowingly, got the phone with a ton of space but this was an awesome addition to the phone and how much I\\'ve been able to store on it. Highly recommended. This card is great for any device that will accept a micro SDHC.  Class 10 write speed is a big bonus for recording high definition video!  I am very satisfied with this purchase. I have installed the product on my Surface runing windows 8 RT. Seems to recognize 57 gigs not bad. Thats almost all of it. If you have dealt with memor before you will know that several gigs are lost to programing. I purchased this product a few months back as a replacement for another 32GB Sandisk memory card that wasn\\'t even a year old that ceased to work. After using this memory card for a few months I started having the same problem where the card randomly stops working or is not even recognized by my Galaxy S3 phone. I tried plugging it into my computer with the provided adapter and it seldom gets recognized. This card is not worth the money for it will not last. Buy PNY or any other brand. Sandisk has lost a customer.03/12/2013 - Amazon.com rocks! They refunded the full amount of the purchase! Kudos to them! It has work great.....i have used it a lot iun my smartphone to storage photos music and game roms....works perfect I have an Asus Tf300 16gb, and I just plugged it right in and it worked without a flaw. The only annoying things, the card may get stuck in the sd adapter, so you might want to be careful with that. Other than that its great. Shipped on time, great prices, these are regularly like $70 to $100 This was a good investment for my galaxy note 2, i had to use the perseus kernel to swap the internal memory with this little guy, so right now, my phone reports internal memory of 59GB, so that\\'s great. It\\'s good saving pictures, full hd videos, games, etc. I\\'m hoping this one behaves as good as it is now for at least a year.ill Update if something goes wrong.Very fast. works perfect with no issues on my phone Samsung Galaxy S 3, and Galaxy Note 10.1. . . . . great price for a great product. I purchased for my phone but I can also use in my camera. NO issues so far and for the price you can not beat. I got a Samsung S3 and wanted to get the max amount of memory on it so I decided to get this memory card. I do not regret it you won\\'t run out of memory easy. I have 7 1080p movies on it and I still have a whole lot of memory to spear. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. I use this memory card for my tablet that has many pictures and games and also my music, one can not go wrong with lots of music and this memory card really helps me keep it all. I was a bit skeptical about getting this card because the official instructions for this phone only mention that the external memory is expandable UP TO 32gb. I did a bit of research before purchasing & many reported being able to use this card with the EVO 4G LTE. I can confirm that it works!At first, the phone won\\'t recognize the card. YOU NEED TO FORMAT THE CARD WHEN YOU FIRST INSTALL IT! once you format the card, the phone will recognize it & you can write & read data with no issues.I got such a large card because of music. I wanted to add music in .wav format for better audio quality (or at least in mp3 320kbs). I\\'m very happy with this card! Ultra fast delivery.Fast performance, and compatible with my samsung phone, my portable speaker sharkk, and my PC.I recommend it. I trust Sandisk lot as the best brand in sd memory... I\\'m not quite sure how to review a memory card, but here it goes... I got the 32gb version and it works perfectly with my galaxy tab 2 7.0...and that\\'s about it haha. the amazon frustration free package was pretty nice and i also liked the little plastic case and micro sd to sd converter it brought. I still think i have sometimes problem reading with the memory, but i can\\'t prove it, still works, never had an error by reading or writing, so 4 stars for you! This is a great speed card.More than 20 MB/sec. Works perfect on my Android device Samsung Galaxy SII (GT-I9100). Also works perfect using CyanongenMod 10.1.The only downside: the price. Is an expensive card.I use it for music playback, like PowerAmp, Spotify and Rdio. Works flawless. I purchased this product for my Samsung Galxy Tab Pro 10.1, and so far it\\'s been flawless. Everything works just right. This product has excellent quality! No problems so far. Fast reading and data transferring. I love it! Taking pictures like crazy without any worries. Reliable product indeed. I use it to store movies for my kids to watch on theirAndroid Tablet. It works flawlessly. Price finally down to earth. To be honest i purchased this because my son said I needed it with my tablet...I\\'m sure it will be fine... Good stuff! Works with my newly bought Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch, Wi-Fi)  no problems at all. I am happy. Ok, this won\\'t be a technical review or a rating of measured speeds. It is simply a review from a consumer point of view. I have bought a couple of these MicroSDXC memory cards for tablets, and have seen no lag in saving data. I also use them for digital cameras, and have been very happy with the record time - it\\'s instant. You can get into the MB/s on various cards, but usually, the difference is not something that anyone would notice or see. For the price, this is an excellent memory card, and I would highly recommend it. I was using mine in a GoPro Hero 3.  The card just broke for no reason.  There is controversy weather its the GoPro or SanDisk, but after doing some Google research it seems that its more of SanDisk\\'s fault as these SD cards also fail (or used to) in varies Samsung devices (phones / tablets).  Amazon sent me a replacement, so no harm done, but for the money you would expect something top notch.GoPro users (on the support forums) recommend getting 2x32GB SD cards, which have not had any issues as far as anyone knows.  The worst part is losing important content, I was lucky, I copied my movies from the SD card onto a HD on my PC.  Others not so lucky. Does as it is supposed to. Everything is working as expected.The product is very good, the speed transfer is OK.I use it with my Xperia SmartPhone This is the second time I have purched this SanDisk card. I have one in my Note 3 and now one in my new Galaxy Note Pro 12.2. I really wanted the 128GB for my Pro but the price was too high for me to justify spending around $120 when this one is currently around $43. I hope the price drops soon on the 128GB! This was simple to install and didn\\'t require formatting on either device, just plug and save. It was that easy. Works great and price was not too bad either. Worked perfect with out having to format it. Transfer rate was fast when I loaded 20 movies and 9 GB of musice and 2 GB of pictures all at the same time. It took a total of 30 min. probably because I had multiple transfers at same time but works great for my new bought Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. Thanks It\\'s way faster than I expected, Brings plenty of storage for very a cheap price. I can fully recommend this item. Works perfectly on my GoPro camera Silver Edition HD 3+. Been in use for about three months with no problems. Highly recommend. Memory is typically a go/no go kind of deal - speeds can also be a factor but in reality I have nothing to really challenge the speed claims of this memory so that is a moot point. I purchased this for my gopro hero 3 and it worked ok for a while, then suddenly the camera would only record about 10 seconds at a time.  After reading some forums online, I was prompted to swap this Sandisk out for a Samsung card.  All of my problems went away!  I still use this card for random storage, but I won\\'t use it in a camera again. Does a good job at a nice price. I like this. It came on time and fits well in my Dell Venue Pro With this card I picked up for $35 amazon\\'s black friday sale, I increased my GNII\\'s storage to 80GB! It transfers data at about 15MB read/write, which is well below advertised. However, this is very similar to the speed that my GNII\\'s built in storage transfers data at, so when running large applications off of this SD card I see no difference in speed than running apps off of the phone itself. Nothing interesting to write. It works just fine and holds a lot of info for such a little card. Thanks. I have been using this card for about a month now, in my Contour ROAM 2 camera, and it has performed flawlessly. I have not had any issues, and have deleted and re-used several times. So far, so good! Bought this for Canon Powershot N because it takes a micro. I always use ultra or extreme pro sandisk, since they are my preferred brand, and I like them for had video and continuous snapshots. No problems with the card, came with working adapter. Happy with this purchase would and probably will buy more. Its fast. I use it every day in my Samsung Epic Touch 4G. I will never need to worry about needing extra space. No, I didn\\'t do any speed tests.Card works great in my Galaxy sIII.Would leave it at that but the guidelines required 6 more words. work as expected. very fast. actually is installed in a HD car camera (DVR) and recording every day, every move. good product. 100% recommended. I had been using a \\'regular\\' SanDisk 32GB Micro SD card that came included with my HTC Thunderbolt I bought in 2011. The size was decent, but I never realized until upgrading how much I was lacking on the speed.I finally got one of these to replace my old card with my Galaxy S3. It is superb. I just recently got a Galaxy S4, and again, this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phone.With my old MicroSD card, I had gotten used to just sitting there, zoning out, as I waited patiently for my computer to transfer pictures/videos off my card to be backed-up to my PC\\'s hard drive, or copying some music files from my PC to my card. With this new card, almost any single file (even hundreds of megabytes big) is an instant transfer, that transfers too quick to even bring up that &#34;moving&#34; dialog box in Windows 8. On my very big transfers (lots of HD video files at once, totaling several gigabytes), I have to wait, but I\\'m waiting for seconds instead of minutes.Combine the excellent speed with the fact that 64GB can hold a ton of data (compared to typical storage sizes on phones), and you have a very satisfied customer. Now I can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my PC, though I try not to.A lot of phones (like my S4) specify 64GB SDXC cards as the maximum they support, so this is about the best you can even get for the moment, unless you want to pay almost double for SanDisk\\'s Extreme cards. Unless you have money to burn, I think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point. But perhaps my next phone will support 4K HD video onto 256GB cards and I will yet again need to upgrade my card\\'s capacity and speed... Anyway, bottom line on this product: AWESOME. Bought this a few months back for my phone... but after switching phones to one that didn\\'t support extra storage I reformatted and stuck it on my car stereo full of music. Even at full capacity it has been there for months now playing without a hitch. Music only take about 5 seconds after starting the car to start playing, skipping, fast forwarding or searching all works flawlessly. The stereo is to be given some props here but if the card wasn\\'t up to par it clearly wouldn\\'t be as fast as it is. Very glad with the purchase. Will buy again if the need ever comes. With technology improving upon solid state memory extremely quickly, there\\'s no excuse to buy the best in speed, without sacrificing quality.Many 32gb cards are Class 2/4, which makes them very slow. If you\\'re going to be utilizing 32gb of data for photos/videos, your phone or just super small storage, you\\'re much better off purchasing a faster card such as this. The price is right, and even if it\\'s a little more expensive than the Class 2/4 or even 6\\'s, you will regret having pinched a few dollars instead of investing into faster speeds.I currently use this in my Sony Action Cam, and the write speed works perfectly for me, as well as the reading speed to transfer files off the card. I used this to turn my Nook Color into an android.  It was incredibly easy to install and works great.  I haven\\'t had any problems with it.  The read and write speeds are phenomenal, given that I am running an entire operating system off just this card.  The price was great too! The 64gb version does not seem as reliable as the lower gb versions. I have had to reformat this card twice .. a real nuisance. When its working .. it does well. I have come to trust the SanDisk brand for file storage and was not disappointed with this card.  It has held up to months of constant file writing and re-writing with use in a dash cam that loop records.  I recommend this card to anyone. I ended up with two of these after mistakenly purchasing the regular sized SD cards for Hikvision security cameras only to find that they needed the micro SD cards instead.  They installed and formatted with no issues and are working well in the cameras.The best thing about Sandisk is that they have a lifetime warranty with these cards unlike some of the other brands.I purchased these for 45 dollars each and are reasonably priced around that. I bought this Class 10 SD card for my GoPro 3 Black and it works great! I only recorded with 1080p 60fps with ProTunes and never had any problems. In the past in my GoPro Hero2 it was very picky with the SD card that you use. But so far this card works great. I do not trust the transfer speed test because there are so many factors that change the outcome (card reader, USB version, hard drives, and etc). I use this in my Dell Venue 8 Tablet. I have loaded it up with movies (MP-4\\'s) and they playback flawlessly. However if it try to add a very large movie (4GB+) my windows 7 machine says that it is too large for the destination format. I shrink them down when that happens. Again, I am very happy with this purchase. Just wanted to point out a small limitation. It\\'s inside of my Galaxy S3, and has worked great. It greatly helps expand the 16 gig internal memory, so I can store music and videos better. does what it suppose to do....works great works well. good price. would buy another. good storage for any digital file. Good product, it arrived extremely fast and performs just as described. It was considerably cheaper than any other store I found. I specially like the speed of this SD Card. However do keep in mind that the speeds tend to be exaggerated. The speeds are way faster than normal SD CARD speeds and you will notice it, but not anywhere close to whats advertised. There a lot of factor that go in to consideration when it comes to the advertised speed. This is not the manufacture or seller fault, but it depends on the system that is being used. Got two of these - one for our Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet and one for my Samsung Galaxy Note II cell phone.  Both devices had no problem recognizing the new 64gb cards.  Couldn\\'t be any easier to use.  Nice to have a large amount of storage on both devices.  The easy to open packaging was a real treat.  I did not use the adapters as I just connect my phone and tablet to my laptop via USB to transfer music, photos and music. Even though it\\'s a class 10 card, writing data to it still takes a while. However, the card performs well in my phone. If you can get a good deal on this, you won\\'t be disappointed. Made the mistake of leaving it in the car when I had a flat and had to buy 4 new tires. Went missing at the dealership so I never got to use it. bought for our recent GoPro purchase to hold many videos/shots. No problem with installing or viewing from chip. SanDisk is our go to product for memory cards. i bought this sandisk ultra 32 gb micro SDHC memory card for my go pro hero white edition, is really good anD works perfecly, try it, you wont regret!! It Failed. It only worked 3 months.I used it in a Galaxy S3 phone. It seems that this brand has an issue with this model.I lost the information. Noticeable improvement to my Sprint HTC EVO LTE with this.Camera app used to have bad pictures when I shot in burst mode (several frames per second). With this card it never misses a burst picture.Also apps that have been installed to the SD card are a lot more responsive.Update:Card has died on me, as of May 12th 2013. I originally ordered this October 22, 2012. So I got about 6 months out of it. Oh well. Its a good Micro card, self explanatory, I haven\\'t had any issues with it. Works for just about putting anything on it. I needed more memory because my phone kept telling me I was short on memory. This is more than enough memory and I have so many pictures on my phone now! This was a good buy! SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter, exactly what was expected and what was described.  Could not ask for anything more. What can you say.  It is a memory card and it works.  The price was good for the size of card. It arrived quickly, was easy to install, now, if I can just figure out how to save data onto it from my device... There were Known Issues with Sandisk and GoPro HERO3 Cameras. So much so that if you paid attention, you\\'d see that GoPro discontinued selling Sandisk MicroSD cards on GoPro\\'s website. Good thing too, because GoPro was totally over-charging customers for MicroSD cards, and still are!Having said all that, I\\'d like to share with you that the Sandisk Class 10 32GB MicroSD card works perfectly with my HERO3+ Black Camera.PROS:Immediate recognition of MicroSD Card by my computerImmediate recognition of MicroSD Card by my HERO3 and HERO3+ CameraClass 10 Speed allows me to do minor edits right from the MicroSD Card, even through USBClass 10 Speed makes file transfers quick and painlessCONS:Had trouble being recognized by my HERO3 camera I have had this card for a couple of days and I am very pleased with it. I bought it for use in my Toshiba Thrive 7\" tablet, mainly for storing movies. I used it with the included adapter in my HP netbook (which is where my movies are stored) and it worked with no problem. The transfer of 4 movies took about 15 minutes altogether, and they all played perfectly when I put the card back into my Thrive. For this price and with Prime shipping, there was no way I could pass it up! I will probably be ordering more of these in the future. Product arrived on time not excessively packaged. Worked perfectly out of the box. Speed is excellent as I can play movies on it and the large file transfer time is very quick on the tablet. good scan disk but the wrong one for my camera I needed a class 6 this class 10 locks up for no reason and even will lock up my computer when it does.. Very reasonably priced for a product that works very well. I have never had any problems with SanDisk products so I highly recommend it to everyone. I purchased this for my husband, he\\'s had this quite a while now and love it SanDisk is a reputable product. bought for my go pro and i love how much info it can hold.. graet price couldn\\'t go wrong. It just works, what more is there to say.  These days every smart phone needs as much memory space as possible. I had purchased a used HTC phone... that the kid had taken the original 8meg card out (I did not know it came with one till I reviewed the specs online)Well... that was OK... I would have upgraded anyway - this got here in 2 days because of being a prime member... and fits good - works flawlessly. Plenty of space, works like a champ. Speeds are fine for a tablet - I mean how fast do these need to be? Transfers go smoothly and the cards read well. I take my tablet to the gym in the morning and either watch movies stored on this card or stream Slingbox from the house. This allows me to store a lot of movies at one time. Works great. This is larger than I need but on a long vacation I did not want to start deleting photos or videos to make room for others so this was way more than I needed for several hundred large photos and lots of 20 to 30 second videos as well with  lots of memory left over. Actually a  8gb would have been  enough. The card worked well and I\\'m happy with my purchase. After reading many reviews I decided to purchase this card for my new galaxy S3 phone. I powered off my phone  ,removed the back cover and put this card in and turned my phone on and I did not need to format it or anything it was ready to go. So far so good. the 64 gb class 10 memory will be useful and I think this was a good buy.I will be using it in my GoPro Hero 3 Black. Do not think I have ever had a bad product from Sandisk.  Currently using the card in my Lumia 810.  Music, pictures podcasts and all other media play on it fine. Card works great, but the adapter was too loose to make full contact with the micro card to facilitate connectivity to the card reader.  Minor issue since I have several adapters... But it\\'s worth noting. Due to other reviews I was a little hesitant to order this unit.  My experience was pain free; I installed it and powered-on the phone.  My Lumia 810 (WP8) automatically recognized the new memory and prompted me to use it for new pictures, music and videos.  Hoorary! Plugged it into my Samsung Galaxy II, and the memory appeared - what more can I say other than it has performed exactly as expected. It\\'s a 32Gb micro card, it works well and haven\\'t had any issues with it. Would recommend if you are considering. This card is the fastest they make right now, the 32GB size is the upper limit that many phones and devices can handle like my Droid X phone.  I actually use it in my new Rikomagic mk802 III tv adapter and it works great. I am a music junkie and I use my phone as much as a mp3 player and video recorder, then as an actual phone, that I chew up memory quick. Thanks, to Sandisk and my Q10 I can keep expanding my storage. I inserted the 128gb Microsd card and it works great. I didn\\'t even have to format it. My tablet see 119gb which is still good. Once I read the reviews about the card it made me think second about it. SanDisk fixed all the issues they had in the previous years to the point where all I have to do is stick the card in the slot and the space is available. GREAT JOB SANDISK for listening to people\\'s complaints and fixing issues in the past. Just bought 2 new windows cell phones, and of course wanted as much storage capacity possible. So far no problems with the card at all, and do not foresee any. Allows me to store quite a few movies in my razr.  Sandisk is THE brand for memory, all of my USB memory thumb drives are Sandisk.. Great card. just what I was looking for, for my surface. Now I need nine more words for Amazon limit. I wanted a good sized SD card for my Android phone. This one was priced well and has been working without a glitch. works great with my samsung galaxy note 2.  just stuck it in and it worked. no formatting needed.  very fast which and no loss of camera speed I was looking for a simple, reliable and fast micro SD chip which I could use with both my new chromebook and my galaxy s3. This product does exactly that. Movies won\\'t lag and with the adapter you can easily use it for laptop and cell devices. Great buy! Perfect for my Sansa Clipp MP3 player.  Plenty fast, and was priced right. Good transfer speed Gives me more time and memory when I\\'m riding with Shiftn Steel Sport Riderz and want to get some great footage This memory card works like any other card.  I\\'ve hard zero problems with it and it was easy to install.  I would buy it again. I can take plenty of pictures and put all my music on my phone.  Works great for what I use it for. I purchased a Car-Cam from Amazon and it was recommended from another reviewer to purchase a 32GB Class 10 Card USB memory card and I\\'m glad I followed the recommendation.  Before I received this card I had already received the Cam so I thought I would try my other card from my tablet.  NOT; the Cam wouldn\\'t recognize the card.  Being a Class 10 is a better quality and will work with most devices. what can I say besides what the title says, Plenty of memory....plug and play and a GREAT price...you won\\'t be sorry!!!  :) The thing I hate about writing reviews for products like this is that they either work or they don\\'t. There\\'s not a lot of &#34;user experience&#34; to be had. If the card is fast enough and doesn\\'t give you read/write errors then it should get five stars, right?Five stars! Balance of trusting the name on the brand & price. Felt like the price I paid was a good value. Installed this into my new Galaxy tablet and sure is nice to have the extra memory, allows for additional apps. When you are looking for a high end SD card with great write speeds look no further than Scan Disk Ultra Works perfect in Samsung Tab 2. It quadrupled my storage capability and seems to be very fast.  I would recommend to anyone I have lately purchased two micro-SD card one Sandisk Ultra 64GB microSDXC and 1 Sandisk Extreme Pro microSDHC 16GB. The first one claim 30MB/s the second claims 90-95MB/s. I 5 tests on my Galaxy Note 2 and 3 different benchmark test on my computer using USB 3.0 card reader. I can only get 7-8MB/s (this not even class 10, let alone UHS-1). I even did real world testing by copy a large set of data (2GB of photo).The result is no different. I do own Sandisk extreme SDHC card on my T3i and I do get 65MB/s of transfer rate. I strongly recommend consumers to test their premium (UHS-1) microSD. I felt very disappointed on Sandisk. I will try other brand like Samsung, Patriot or Lexar. Extremely happy with this memory card. Very fast, and have not had a problem since I bought it almost 6 months ago. This is definitely faster than my old 16GB card and seems to work just fine so far in my S4. Have used it a lot for the last few weeks. Works perfect in the Surface RT. Easily integrated into the file structure by using the Libraries function of Win RT. this works great. ive saw ppl getting fakes at times. this was not the case. it worked in my evo 4g with formatting. turned it into two different 32 gig files but works as one. ive got more memory on my phone than i do on my laptop which is crazy. This doesn\\'t work on the galaxy note 10.1. It is getting detected however it is not being utilized by the note 10.1. I have been using it for over a year now in my galaxy S3 and it seems fast and reliable.  Do we really know how good they are until it goes out or crashes? I bought it to my GoPro 3 Black and it worked very good with videos at 1080P...very cheap compared with the prices at Best Buy. its geniune and performs as expected in my ASUS TF300T  tablet.  Includes sd adapter and has a nice sandisk app in the play store. i love this micro sd.  It enables me to expand the storage space on my Acer W3.  Great price too, Works well, as advertised. I like the Class 10 speed. Price was right. Would recommend this product to others. Thank you. Yes it meet me expectation. This is the best headphone I\\'ve had. The Good frequency response and a lot of Bass, which most phones don\\'t have. I would recommend this product to anyone... Since I bought this card, I\\'ve been using it almost daily in my Hero 3 camera. The recordings are without any glitches so far. Some reason this card (and a replacement card) did not work with my GoPro Hero 3+.....therefore I could only give the card a 3* instead of a 5......ive also read that many people are having the same problem with ALL brands of micro SD 64 gb cards. I used this to take pictures. It works good. I think it works just as good as any other memory card I have ever used. Fit my needs nicely in my tablet.  No more buffering anything anymore.  And big enough to hold quite a few movies on. love it planty of space for my pictures and videos and more very small and can be use in other items This rating is based on multiple years of use of this memory card. Its reliable and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a memory card for long term use. This SanDisk Ultra Micro SDHC Memory Card is a great example of how technology has made our live\\'s simpler, better and richer.  No prep necessary; just remove it from the packaging, and plug and play.  I use mine in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 as its external memory to hold all my music, pictures and videos, and it runs flawlessly.  I haven\\'t had a chance to use the adapter yet, although I have devices that take it.  It\\'s a nice addition, one I think should be standard these days with this type of technology.Price was very competitive, the packaging was excellent, and the product arrived sooner than expected.  Overall, I had a great experience with this purchase.  I usually go with the big names for electronics, and it\\'s not let me down yet.  I highly recommend this product. get it $9.9,so worthful.speed is fine , camera  can use it with the adapter. so useful, i love it ! I bought this to expand the limited memory of my Dell Venue Pro. I use it to store MP4 videos and MP3 music and streaming/playing both work very well. Even the description explicitly says &#34;Reformat into file system other than exFAT may cause instability&#34; I\\'d hope to use it to remap my OneDrive (FKA SkyDrive) folder which requires it being reformatted to NTFS.  The warning is correct--between Windows 8.1, the tablet and the SanDisk MicroSDXC the OS became unstable.  Once I\\'d reformatted and changed OneDrive\\'s location to it I rebooted Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 could not detect the card. I reformatted the card back to exFAT and it works as expected. My Galaxy s3 (and me) couldn\\'t be happier- good price arrived quickly and what can I say - it does what its supposed to do! Works perfectly.  Nothing else to say as it\\'s just a memory card and it holds the pictures and videos I put on it.  I would not say anything, but again, you need 20 word minimum. Does anyone really need this much space? Hard to say, after about 20GBs of pictures and 40GBs of music, I started to wonder myself, if it was really necessary. But then I realized I had forgotten about adding movies! 50GBs of movies later I can definitely say I don\\'t need this card and really just wanted it for the fun of it, but it /is/ nice to have your /entire/ collection of music in your phone, for someone with a bigger collection then me I\\'m sure this card would be a God-send. I received the SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card as estimated by Amazon on time as promised. The card showed a formated size of 29.71 GB in my Samsung Galaxy EK-GC100 camera, which I was very satisfied with. I purchased my camera at the same time which I also received on the same day. I\\'ve used the camera and memory card several times since then on setup and getting familiar with both products and am very pleased with the performance of both. Thank you Sandisk and Amazon.com Decent storage, used on my GoPro Hero Camera. Windows XP doesn\\'t recognise card and infomation. Would definately buy again, if needed. Not much to say here except that this is a decently priced product from a reliable manufacturer, you can\\'t go wrong. I use this for my 1st generation Surface RT; I store movies on here and watch directly off the SD Card, works great! I have owned these little card for about a year now. Works as intended. No signs of corruption or data loss. I usually always buy sandisk. Have had no issues and does what is advertised.  Very handy.  Quite happy. :)I\\'ve used it with:  Windows 7, Mac OS X.Formatted as: FAT32 and NTFSVery good card. :) Bought this for my Nook HD and it works perfectly without any problems.  I already used about 80% capacity with HD movies, and my Nook HD plays them flawlessly.  Very happy with the product. Card is perfect for use in GoPro. Write\\'s fast and provides for super fast transfers to the computer. Price for two of these was the same as one 64GB card so the decision was easy. I\\'d rather have two cards so that I can swap them out, continue to record and have someone else transfer from the other one. I just received this micro sd card. Everything works so far. I purchased 2 for my Galaxy s5 and my tablet. So far so go. The card works as expected. As long as I don\\'t loose my data prematurely this will get 5 stars.  Overall, recommended. Bought this for my Hero3. It came with a 16GB card. You will get about 1.5 hrs of video on this card. Great price! WOW. Transfer speeds on this MicroSD were phenomenal. I was using it on a Galaxy S2, and transferring everything from music to movies from the phone to my computer were fast. I mean a song per blink fast. The acronyms are getting a little crazy now (SD = Secure Digital, SDHC = Secure Digital High Capacity) and the 1 on the lower left means Ultra High Speed 1. Even I don\\'t know what that means yet, but this thing is F-A-S-T. Whenever I get these cards, the first thing I do is connect it to my Windows 7 or 8 computers, and run this program to format it to FAT32.  Here\\'s the link to the free program:[...]Many phones, cameras and tablets, need the card to be in FAT32 format, and sadly, it\\'s not an option in Windows these days.  You can select NTFS or exFAT, but no option for FAT32 when it comes to this card.Using that program, you can format the card, then load it with whatever music or videos, and the card will work fine in your device.The 4 cards I have have never failed me in the past year, recommended :) It has worked perfectly for last few weeks. I am using it in a Garmin dash cam system. It has replaced the original 4Gig chip originally supplied with the unit. I have been using Sandisk chips for over ten years with absolutely no issues. This is top of the food chain for SD micro chips. This is the third sd card I\\'ve bought. All have performed outstanding. Great for use in my cellphone and tablet.I definitely recommend this card. No problems.  I enjoy the added space for movies. Not sure what else to say about it.  If you need the GBs, get it! And works great. Slipped the card in place and with a small snap I was ready to go. My experience was very satisfied. These work great with Samsung S3 and Note 10.1. Ipads and Iphones got nothing on this, those users are amazed when they see all the parts manuals and technical documents and pictures I have at my fingertips (I have over 30gb of documentation and pdfs and pictures), all without some &#34;cloud&#34; that sucks your data especially when traveling out of the country, and with 32gb device memory still more than half free. Card has failed several times in the phone I installed it in. I purchased it for the phone where it has resided for a month. In that time, it has required reformatting three times which makes its utility useless as a storage device. This microSD is helping me alot for my Samsung Galaxy Note. If you are storing lots of music, photos, and videos for your phone and looking for high speeds rate of reading, then this the wise choice to buy. Got this for my Galaxy S3 after getting it\\'s bigger brother for my new camera. needed the extra space for all my media(music, photos, video) and as usual, Sandisk delivers. Very very satisfied. I was a little disappointed since it came without a box. So, where do I leave the adapter while the card is in the camera? It\\'s a memory card. What else is there to say. This is a Class 10 so it reads and writes files very quickly. Works flawlessly, never had any problems with it and I\\'ve moved data on and off of it constantly. I have several of these microSD cards I found that it\\'s easier to have one for each camera that I have and with the price of these cards you can go wrong.. I have a total of 10 and not one of them has failed! It is a good match for the Sansung ATIV.  I don\\'t know that I have used it yet but, it\\'s in there. I don\\'t like Micro SD cards, but it\\'s a necessary evil to save space on the GoPro Hero 3+. I find that they are too easy to misplace and it\\'s annoying having to keep the empty shell around when I need to transfer the data to my computer via the SD slot. That said, the Class 10 speed is nice and I haven\\'t had any real world data rate problems when shooting GoPro footage even at the higher frame rates and resolution. This SanDisk brand is one of the most accurate and secure for SD memory cards. I recommend it for sure. There really isn\\'t much to say about this card other than it\\'s been very reliable and handles HD video from my GoPro Hero 3 very well and without a glitch.I\\'m not offering any benchmarks or other measurements of speed in comparison to other Class 10 MicroSD cards. All I can tell you is that this card has yet to fail me and I am a longtime video professional who works in a commercial/advertising/marketing environment, so I need things to be reliable for all of my clients.Recording and transferring video from device to computer is a snap and I\\'ve had no issues with it since I began using it. For the price, this is the bast for android phone, very fast and holds alot of stuff on it.I would recomend this for phone or for camera I bought this card for my Samsung Galaxy phone. I have mounted the card and my apps are using it but I can\\'t seem to get my photos to store there. It works just fine and gives me the added storage capacity I want I now need to figure out how to use it. This brand is really the only brand I would consider buying. Have used this same SD card in me Galaxy S3 for the whole time I had it then put it in my S4 when I got that and have had no issues.  Has been fast and reliable and I have gotten what I paid for that\\'s for sure. did not work when first inserted into my samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1 with ICS. put it in my samsung galaxy sII phone which recognized it and formatted it. then placed it back in my tablet and 57GB are available. should note that my phone was not running ICS at the time, that was yesterday and now it has ICS on it. So not sure if that matters but it does work and i now have a 64GB micro SD card that works in my tablet and pc and phone. so much for the 32GB limit.Enjoy! Super fast and quick read/write which i\\'m using for my GoPro and Surface Pro. Ok, this is how I transferred the files on my old microSD card to this one.1. Turn off device and remove old microSD card2. Put old microSD card in adapter and put into laptop (SD card can be found in &#34;My Computer:).3. Copy all the files and paste onto laptop in &#34;My documents&#34;4. Remove old microSD card and insert new microSD card into laptop.5.Copy files in &#34;My documents&#34; and paste them directly to new microSD.6. Put new microSD in the device and turn device on. Enjoy the space!-Quick note: The actual space on this card is roughly 29.7 GB due to some formatting and files already on the card. Hope this helps. Works great.  Use it in my Galaxy Note 3 to store music, files, etc.  The adapter is handy for transferring files from PC to card without using a USB cable and going through the phone - seems to go faster.  Still can\\'t believe they can cram 64 GB (shows up as just under 60 on the phone, by the way) on something the size of a fingernail. Popped this into my Samsung Galaxy S4 right out of the box. No issues whatsoever. Have saved music, movies, photos, etc, with no issue. The adapter works in my computer and printer. Well i got it for my go pro hero 3. the hero 3 takes this instead of regular sd cards, it seems to be working fine and its the same type that go pro sells of of their site for the hero 3. Just received this today. Removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) and powered the unit back up and the storage was available. No formatting required. Worked the first time out. Settings showed 29.71GB of total space (32GB version) and 29.71GB of free space. I like the fact that a SD adapter came with it. Should I ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy. (yes I can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if I ever swap this 32GB card out of my phone and replace it with a 64GB version, I can use this 32GB version via the adapter for other purposes.) Exactly what you\\'re hoping for in a micro-SD card. Tons of space and super fast. And YES--local storage is absolutely necessary for media storage! Tunes, videos, even pictures....back them up on the cloud, but keep a copy/copies local! THis is GREAT for my tablet, OMG I have SO MUCH STUFF on storage that it would take me forever to read, listen, and watch it all. Very nice. Very nice indeed. It went into my phone and stores my pictures well.  I just take it out and plug it into my laptop and transfer pictures. WE use these in our phones to carry our favorite tunes or take lots of pictures.  They are excellent quality. And this isn\\'t an add for an apartment.  More room than I need, but I am bit OCD and tidy up my texts, emails, and picture often.  I think most woman might need a Terabyte Micro-SD card?  LOL, J/K ladies!!! I connected it to my galaxy S4, but every now and then (once or twice a week) it will eject from my phone and the phone will need to re read the card. It\\'s not a big issue, but when it happens you may need to wait like 4 min for your files.It happens a lot less now that i dont use the powersaving funtion. Something about the powersaving on the phone seems to not deliver enough power to the card. Absolutely a perfect MicroSD Chip.4500 songs were transferred into it, effortlessly and I have  balance of about 50% of usable space.SanDisk is a synonym with all Engineers and I need not add any thing to glorify it.Thank you SanDisk thank you AMAZON.SincerelyKJ Kumar Works well with the tablet and htc phone, it doesn\\'t need to do formatting. The devices recognized immediately with no problem. Recommended! lots of room on here for movies, video, if you need the space, this is it, and they offer more GB too Always Buy More Memory is my new rule. This memory card is easy to use and captures loads of video, but you do need to download every PM. Works fine with my Mac, have not used it with a PC. Loaded songs for my bluetooth headset and it sounds great.  No issues so far. Works GREAT ! ! ! ! 100% compatible!!! Very fast on my Asus table, highly recommended for any kind of files, specially for movies because of its speed. Tony the Tiger has nothing on this deal. It was only $1 more for this chip than it is for the generic version from Micro Center, so I could not resist. I tossed this into a Samsung Galaxy Note II, which I also love. With the adapter, I can use this with DSLRs and other video-capturing items that demand a lot of data transferred faster.  It\\'s pretty crucial especially when you can snap off 10 to 15 photos per second to get some really good sequences and every little bit helps when your files are 8MB a piece. Something this small with so much information stored on it freaks me out. But I\\'ve had zero problems with it over the past year. The only issue I had is that the adapter that came with it did not work. The microsd card went into it kind of sidways like it was made wrong. Luckily I had another adapter lying around, and the sd card itself works perfectly and I\\'ve had no issues with data loss or corruption. i was reading some reviews about this and honestly i really don\\'t notice the speed. but the storage of it is epic. 64gb card +32gb phone = ... a lot of information.... and i save and store alot of things. For me its a great card to hold stuff and a speed i really don\\'t noticed, However i want to add that this card is not slow i just don\\'t notice the difference using a 32gb class4 vs 64gb class10 on a e890(optimums g PRO) This is a great addition to a tablet. I store and watch movies on it as well as music and pictures. It does everything it says it does in its description and i have had it for about a year with no issues at all. I cant really think of anything bad to mention at all except that its so much memory in much a small package it could be the easiest way to loose nearly 100 movies in a washing machine and not even notice. best best best productreliableown a fewone isnt enoughgood price I guesswill prob buy more at some point I bought this to expand the capacity of my Galaxy S5 for music, pictures, and video. I plugged the card into the phone...and I have about 60GB more space. I don\\'t notice any lag from the phone accessing files from this card as opposed to internal memory. It seems just as fast. I have no complaints.  The micro SD is very fast and fits nicely into the adapter as well.  Great buy. I plugged this into my Galaxy S3 and the memory was read immediately without having to reformat the disc or do any other preparation. It was just plug and play. 32GB was plenty of space to put my music collection and still have space for recording HD video (in addition to the on board hard disc of the phone). The phone even prompted me as to change the default location of photos and videos. I bought this for my LG Optimus G Pro, to hold my 24 GB music collection - it works great.  It took a while to transfer all my music, but that can be expected.  Once I popped this into the phone and started us the music player, it found a cataloged all my music.  I don\\'t like the latest default Android music player, but that\\'s another story (and there are other music players you can download). Works perfectly in my gopro black edition and offers a lot of space, very happy overall. would recommend to friends. Haven\\'t had much time to place items on this card yet.  Formatted to my Samsung Galaxy Tab no problem.  Seems to do the job will keep you posted if problems arise? Got a great price on this 64gb memory card. It works fine. The speed is OK, nothing blazing (took a few minutes to move 10gb of data), but it serves my purposes. It has been reliable for me over the past few months. Writes & reads really fast. The card that came with my dash cam would pause about 11 seconds between files. With the Ultra there is only a one second pause. Now I won\\'t be returning the dash cam. Highly recommend! It\\'s 64GB and it\\'s in my phone.  Really, that\\'s all you need for a review.  What more could you want?  I have all my music, several movies and I can record stuff on camera at full HD without worrying about running out of space.  No issues at all.  Did I mention it\\'s 64GB? As a quick note, unless they\\'re on sale, it\\'s best to avoid buying these in big box stores because they almost always seem to be overpriced. I purchased three of these for family members for their Samsung S4 phones and they\\'re all very happy and pleased with them. I needed this for my phone. I listen to a lot of music and 32 GB\\'s is not enough. It took me a while to get it to work since my phone is older and not capable of working with Ex-Fat, but once I got that straightened out, it\\'s worked great. SanDisk  is consistently the best media out there.  It works ever time and is always compatible with all my devices.  I have never had an issue with SanDisk.  Quote simply, they just work. Worked as advertized, loads fast.  Only problem was pulling it out of the adapter after Loading it on my computer. Works great, I\\'m not a techie kind of person hence don\\'t know if the speed and ratings are for real.. But it works for me the extra room on my phone is great but ive noticed since installing it that its a lil slow when transferring files from my phone to the card, its not like im sitting there forever but its a noticeable difference between my old card and this one Was very concerned when I realized this sd card was NOT the correct one for go pro.  But all seems ok at this time. Bought this to add additional memory to my Nokia Lumia 520 and works great as soon as I popped in the card. works as advertised. Using this with Q10 which supports only 32gb. So far no issues. totally happy with the purchase. Scan Disk 64 Gig for under $40 there was nothing to decide.  I spent the money and was glad i did. really fast memory card, go along well with the GoPro. front side feels great in the hand so you won\\'t forget to put it in the save area when you are grabbing it Had had this for about 6 months now and it\\'s in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Haven\\'t had any storage issues and it was a breeze to put in the phone.  I went with SanDisk because of their reputation and reliability.  Sure... I could have gone a little cheaper in price, but it wasn\\'t all that expensive to start with, so why not spend a little extra and get something that will last. Works great and it is so nice to have enough space for all my movies and books, comics and such that I like to keep on my tablet. I love these cards, 3rd one I\\'ve bought now. Never any buffer issues from my GoPro Hero3+, Nikon v1 nor Nikon 5200. This card only lasted two weeks before it began giving read errors. I used it in a dash cam and no matter how many times I formatted, it would only record for about a minute before failing again. I picked up a PNY card since and it has worked beautifully. Unfortunately, I\\'ve been swamped and forgot to return this card before my 30 days. Not happy about that! I bought this with the sole intention of putting it in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I had to use a tool to format the card to FAT32, but once I did so, the card worked great. I have been taking advantage of the extra room I have for music, videos, pictures, etc. The SD adapter that comes with this is also handy.The transfer speeds didn\\'t feel like class 10 when connected and transferred files from my computer, but my computer is 5 years old, so it\\'s very possible that it\\'s the problem. Other than that, I\\'m completely satisfied. A lot of the other class 10 micro SD cards that came out seemed to have issues after a year of usage.  This one works great in my Galaxy S3.  I also like the color on the card, so much better than just black! So stylish. (except it\\'s hiding inside the back of my phone)  Maybe I should make a clear window just where the micro SD card is.  So everyone knows I am using the SanDisk Ultra class 10. hmm This tiny little card fit right into the slot on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.The tablet recognized it right away and after some tweaking we are using the card as a storage backup for music, photos and video. I just removed the back cover and plugged this into our new Galaxy S4 and the phone recognized it immediately (indicated had 59.47GB of storage available on SD card) ... I loaded some pics and videos on it for good measure and it works fine...recognized the SDXC.  I assume it is file system formatted for exFAT. Works well.  Came with an SD adapter and I\\'m using it in a portable video camera.  Captures everything, even 1080p at 30 fps just fine.  No rate issues. I tested it in several UHS-1 compliant devices and found the write speed at 11-12 MByte/Second. Sounds fine for a class 10 card but this is not what I was paying for. I don\\'t expect it to run anywhere close to UHS-1 interface speed (104 MB/S) but it should be close to 30 MB/S as the manufacturer advertised. I have a lot more choices if I am only looking for a class 10 card.Indeed, microSD cards are usually slower than full-size SD card. They use the same Flash controller so the reason is really microSD cards use slower NAND Flash. Manufacturers know you are not going to use microSD cards in high-speed SLRs so they get to sell you lower quality NAND at a premium. My advice to you the photography enthusiasts is to buy full-size SD cards rather than microSD cards with adaptors.That said, the compatibility is great. It works great with my tablets, PCs, GPSs and phones. That is what I like about SanDisk. They do thorough compatibility tests before product release. works great in my galaxy s4 If price is also double of 64 GB card, then it goes straight to my shopping cart. Otherwise it will remain in my wish list. I needed a large capacity, dependable high speed card for my action cam on a fishing trip and this card delivered in spades! Recording and playback were flawless. I Finally took the plunge and got this guy. I was worried it wouldn\\'t work with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.  After reading some of the reviews how people \\'got it working\\', I finally decided to give it a try.First of all, I want to say there was no \\'getting it to work\\'.  I put it in and it recognized it immediately.  I didn\\'t have to pre-format it or do anything hokey with it.  I used the tablet to format it anyways (there might be some optimization things that can happen), but it work!  Now, I can load all my songs and movies onto one card as opposed to keeping them on two and swapping between them.Hey Samsung, why don\\'t you make a tablet that holds more than one microSD card?  I\\'d buy it.*********** Update **************I bought another one to go in my Galaxy S5 for $40.  Even though the 128GB will work in the phone, I couldn\\'t see paying literally 3x more for only twice the memory.  So these work great! I bought two pieces and they were working well, but after filling one of them with videos, the entire card just failed. I was unable to reformat it, even by using Partition Magic. Otherwise the other one is working just fine. I purchased this to extend my Windows Phone 8 device\\'s memory, and basically put all my music on.  At first, the phone wouldn\\'t recognise the card, but it worked everywhere else I tested it.  Then I had Verizon replace the phone and the card worked perfectly.  No complaints about the performance, and it provides plenty of space for pictures and music. I hate how people complain the transfer speed isn\\'t the &#34;promised&#34;  30/mbs. It even says in the fine print that it depends on the product you are using the card on. I bought this to upgrade my Galaxy Note 2s memory. Bought on sale for about 20$ and Amazon credited me the difference when it went on sale a week later for 17$. Very satisfied great product and great customer service. Thanks Amazon! I have a 4gb and an 8gb micro sd card so I finally had to upgrade since I was getting close to filling up both cards. The micro sd arrived a week before so I do recommend these guys.Update--So for some reason the sd card wants to be dumb and work and not work with my phone (Motorola Razr M). Now I know it\\'s not the phone because it works perfectly fine with the other sd cards I have. I haven\\'t contacted the sellers yet, but probably will soon if it continues to act up. SanDisk has always made reliable products, and this offers good speed, as expected capacity, and good price for its capacity There really isn\\'t a whole lot to say about this. The amount of storage space is fantastic.There are options for using this on older devices, that don\\'t necessarily support MicroSDXC formats. Windows, by default, will only allow you to format the card as exFat or NTFS. These formats will work for most new devices, but some may have issue.If you use FAT32 as the filesystem instead, you can use this card for older devices, and it still works great with Android. I\\'ve been using this card on my old Sandisk Sansa Fuze (running Rockbox) and it works great. I was not expecting that, but I am very happy with it! Samsung gives you the ability to install apps on your SD card with Galaxy devices. I had a class 4 SD card before and initially blamed the tablet. I thought I was going to have to get it replaced. It was the SD card.I got this SD card and have yet to experience any issues! Love this thing! Works perfect, Price is perfect, Cant beat it! I bought this for my Galaxy Note 10.1 and I now have about 48GB total of storage! I purchased this for my Samsung Galaxy lllS.  I never have to worry about running out of storage capacity.  Thousands of songs don\\'t even make a dent. I bought two of these for mine and my husbands phones. They work awesomely so far. Gaining access is quick and there is lots of space. I would recommend this product to others. bought this to replace a faulty card on my phone and it works great. haven\\'t had any performance or corruption issues with it at all. I bought this for my Android phone and it kept stating \"media scanning\" over and over, even when the device was on or not even restarted. I thought it was the phone and was so annoyed. Then did a search and found that several others got a duds from this same batch off amazon. So not only did I pay for this, now I have a useless 32gb card that refuses to hold music on my phone, or anywhere else. I loaded a 4gb card in the same device and it only scans media when restarted and does not lag at all. The phone can hold up to 32 gb too. If you don\\'t believe me, go onto the Sandisk message boards and look. It\\'s a dud. So disappointing. I got this for my gopro hero 3. Works great and reads/ writes fast. Customer service was also awesome as well. Much cheaper than in the store and is just as described in the listing. I like it and would order again. Perfect fit It looks like what\\'s it\\'s supposed to look like.  It does what\\'s it\\'s supposed to do.  I got it for quite a decent price and in timely manner.  #goodstuff There is not much more you can ask for than that. I will be buying more for my airport boredom fighting collection. I don\\'t know why but I just needed some space. This provided me with the space to put all my extra stuff that does not physically exist...but it exists in the realm of awesome stuff. I have space now. It worked great. I have more memory now. oh joy. I bought a SanDisk SSD for my computer.  It\\'s fast for the price.  I feel confident that anything I order made by SanDisk will be of the same quality. I got an amazing price and this is an amazing product. 64 gigs is a lot of memory. I don\\'t think I\\'m ever going to fill it up but it\\'s nice to have it. It has given me no problem so far. Lot\\'s of storage for little money. There is nothing not to like...except I have to keep writing words because there is a minimum required to rate products on Amazon (probably the only thing I don\\'t like about Amazon). I don\\'t like that, but this was a great deal. CompactFlash is just about perfect to use in a camera in the field. As the size shrinks, so does one\\'s ability to easily handle the card. SD is getting marginal as far as usability in the field. Forget about changing a Micro SDHC card unless you are back at your computer! Too small to handle and easy to drop and loose!However, with the 32GB and 64GB cards, that\\'s not quite an issue especially if you leave the card in the camera! The camera is larger than the card my a great deal. Set it down and it\\'s a lot easier to find and handle than a micro card (shown twice as large as life when I was writing this review).My cards came with SD adaptors so that they would be useable in my work flow, a plus. Also, within the adaptor, I can use the card in devices with SD slots and download using my existing readers. I have a problem with the size of these mini cards --they are hard to hold on to  and get in and out of my drift cameras they get stuck all the time Using a pair of these in a Nikon P700 and D5000 cameras. The run fast and store pics just fine. I bought the 64GB Ultra card to increase storage on my Acer A500 Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.3 tablet.  It didn\\'t work as Android doesn\\'t support its native exFAT formatting from the factory.  Insert the card into an SD adapter and plug it into a PC or Laptop under real Windows.  Reformat this card to the NTFS format with Windows Format utility and Android can then read and write any size file, even files over 5GB, to and from this card.  You do NOT need to root or modify the Android tablet in any way, except to have ver 4.0.3 operating system on it.  This product is very fast reading and writing and has proven very reliable...a great value in some really serious storage space. I put this in my Galaxy S4 phone for extra storage and it works perfectly.  I copied my music collection (about 5000 MP3 songs) and put 20 MP4 movies on it with room to spare.  Very handy for listening and watching while traveling on a plane.  The phone likes it, the computer likes it, so I like it. What can I say.  It was a good price and a large capacity card.  It hasn\\'t posed any problems and I use it every day in my Galaxy Note II. I owned one of these for a year before it lost its ability to write to itself. This was very disappointing, but not a deal breaker for me because San Disk products are usually built to last. I believe I just received a bad one from the batch that mine came from. What can you say about a chip? It works, it\\'s fast and has been trouble free. A great product at a great price. Works great. Adapter makes it easy to load music, ebooks, pictures and movies onto card for use on a phone or tablet. What can I say? It\\'s a memory card! Bought for my BlackBerry Z10 some months back. OEM quality. The price was right. Arrived in retail packaging. I recommend this seller and this product. Picked up a Note 3 and added this card for an extra 32GB. Scandisk is top of the line and never gives me any issues when I use their cards. Highly recommended. This was an exceptional deal...especially since they actually sent me a 64GB card instead of a 32GB.  Price is right. ;-) Works well with my new Garin virb elite bought it for my Galaxy Note 10.1 and worked since day one. Easy to use in multiple devices for transferring files also. good quality microsd card. cannot gain 30MB/s read speed but it may be because of 2.0 usb card reader because hdd connected to the same usb port give no more than 20MB/s speed, same as this card. i have bought both 32GB and 64GB. 64GB works perfect in my HTC EVO 3d. trash quality, broke and corrupted my data on two different cards awesome large SD card for all mobile devices, enough room for all my music and even a few movies, buy it!!! Works great I used this on my Android tablet (Pantech Element and my Galaxy S3 phone).  The S3 took it without an issue but the Pantech required me to format it as FAT32.... it wouldn\\'t read it any other way....  you can search the internet for FAT32 formatter which will format the card as FAT32 using an external card reader within seconds.After doing that, I\\'ve been using it for a few weeks now with no problems.  Very nice.  Now... just waiting for the 128GB model.  :) Great Price overall good quality item, worked fine from the start with no problems. Stores photos quick without a lot of hassle. So far has worked as expected, it\\'s difficult to tell is it is going to fail or not soon but for the moment is working pretty well with a good performance. Used in Samsung Galaxy S III phone. Formatted in the phone. Has worked perfectly so far. A very economical storage card. Faster than previous cards I have owned. SanDisk is well know brand. The MSD Ultra 64 GB class 10 is the good one to buy.It transfers file faster than other brand card. I bought two of them when they are on sell.The price is very reasonable. I like it very much. Memory card works awesome and for this much memory for the price is awesome. I use it for my GoPro but you can use it for anything that can take a micro SD. Comes with the bigger SD card so you can put it into a card reader or computer that reads SD cards. I purchased the card in the Sandisk packaging, so I am pretty sure it is genuine. I tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not. This one turned out to be a real Sandisk card. The card came formatted with FAT32.I read on the web about these micro SDs, and apparently they are not as fast as the full SD card version. I borrowed my brothers Sandisk 32gb full SD card to make comparison tests. Here are my official/unofficial test results using DiskBench V2.6.2.0 and H2testw 1.4 test. I will give the results as an \"overall\" result, because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads, the results get mixed and varied to a big degree... much larger than I expected, but the numerous tests showed me a \"general\" trend. The trend is that the full SD cards do write faster than the MicroSD card. But, also remember that the microSD had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my PC while the fullSD card was put into the computer reader directly.These are just my averages, but:Small file writes:Both SD cards wrote at close to 10mb/sec. The microSD was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to 8mb/sec.Small file reads:Both SD cards read at close to 20 mb/sec at their fastest.Large file copies to card:MicroSD wrote at 3.5mb/sec while the fullSD wrote at about 4mb/secLarge file reads copies from card:MicroSD was 10mb/sec while the fullSD read at about 14mb/sec.My conclusion:My tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes, but the fullSD card was faster in many cases, but equal to microSD in most cases. The small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough. But, my only concern is with large file writes.... is 3.5 mb/sec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera? I don\\'t know. I have had no problem using these cards with H264 movie capture for hours. I am surprised that 3.5 mb/sec is enough.Also, never during the huge file copies to the card did I get any noticeable heating of the card itself, by touch even for an hour. I\\'ve noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web, some stating that they felt they might burn themselves. I copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change, other than, perhaps a couple of degrees. Of course, this was on a PC and not installed in a camera.The card performs well for video work, and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people. I never saw a read close to 30 mb/sec... they were very consistent at 20 mb/sec at the highest performance.I would get the card again, if the price were right. Not much to say about this, but it was definitely worth the buy. It comes w/ a small case to hold both itself and the adapter. For just over $10 you really can\\'t go wrong. As Advertised.  Appears to be working okay. No faults have occurred yet with the micro card.Would buy again. A+ This San Disk Micro SDHC is perfect for today\\'s small electronics that need extra storage, such as smartphones, tablets, and cameras, etc. I\\'ve purchased several of these and this brand/version, is among the best. While Amazon usually has great prices on these, make sure you check out sales, especially at Radio Shack, which often beat all others. (No, they don\\'t pay me; I just like to pass along info on good deals when I spot them.) FYI: Radio Shack\\'s sale prices on no-contract smartphones are usually tops as well. I bought my Virgin Mobile Samsung S2 from them and am loving this phone!Back to the memory card, it\\'s so nice to have Android products that take these to expand memory, something the \"I\" guys could really take a lesson in. And if you don\\'t think you\\'ll need the expanded memory, trust me, with photo-taking and all the goodies you can get, you\\'ll want it over time.As one person commented, yes, this memory card comes in various sizes, including the 32GB version I also purchased, which is the max compatible with the devices I have, although 64GB is also available for the latest tech. All this is amazing to this old-timer, whose first desktop PC hard drive had only 500MB storage! Item arrived in a timely manner via USPS (surprisingly).  I bought this card to go in my GoPro camera, it fit in there gerat and now I have 3 hours of recording time. a class 10 micro sd with 32 gd and san disk...its great! no problems so far and is suiting my needs quite nicely! I bought this for an Atrix HD. The specs say maximum 32Gb, but 64 works fine with a formatted capacity of around 58GB.I did a speed benchmark here (I don\\'t know if Amazon strips links)[...] Nice product, perfect package and speed of recording. My camera will stay better with this memory. I recommend for all. Good value for the money, I would recommend having always a few of these around for all photo or film devices This card is a lot faster than my old card which was advertised as a Class 10 as well. Great to have the extra space too. i am not always giving out good comment. But this is perfect, you know , perfect!maybe because of the size... no mistake will happen. Don\\'t really use this for speed tests or anything but to hold music and everything it works great would recommend doesn\\'t fail a lot and lose files If you use one of the  larger MP  taking camera ( 12-14-16 etc)  you need this card.  Taking photos on those kinds of cameras really chews up the smaller MP cards.  Don\\'t go on vacation without at least 1 of these babies, or you\\'ll be having to carry lots of cards and probably end up losing one and your memories. I have been using this memory card for several months now and it is working great. It is wonderful to have a huge selection of eBooks, mp3 files, movies and plenty of space for phone generated photos and video clips.I have not noticed any delay in accessing files on this huge memory card.8/14/13 update - Also Worked out of the box in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 . Works great in my BlackBerry Z10. Holds all I need and it is fast. I really wish there was more to say, but I can\\'t think of Anything. No cons. Card works well. Runs quickly in my wife\\'s Galaxy SII. She would buy it again and I bought one later for my tab 2 7. We have a dash cam that came with only 8 gigs of storage... so we ended up only having the last half of our Moab jeeping adventure.  With these, we will never have to worry about recording over the good stuff I bought these for my ELPH 520 more for speed than space.  I wanted to use the rapid photo taking modes on the camera and wanted to ensure the SD card was not the limit at all.  The UHS-1 cards are supposed to be faster than normal Class 10 cards.  So far I\\'ve had no hiccups or issues taking super high speed video footage and rapid fire images. The moment I got this, I just plugged it into my SGS3 cellphone. I transferred some videos from my cellphone memory directly to the SanDisk Ultra, and it copied real fast. I plan to replace this soon with a higher capacity 32GB variant. Highly recommended brand. Needed extra disk space in my surface pro 1. Put in this item and have had no problems since. Very good performance - similar to my SSD hard drive. This card is fast with no hang ups etc.  Price was very good.  I installed in my phone and have many pictures and a few videos on it so far.  Would buy this card again in a heart beat. Not much to say. It works as expected. Recording speed is great with my GoPro Hero3. The SD adapter works gear as well. ES UNA TARJETA MICRO GUARDA TODAS LA CARACTER&Iacute;STICAS DESCRITAS EN LA PUBLICACI&Oacute;N LLEGO EN TIEMPO R&Eacute;CORD, HASTA EL MOMENTO NO HE TENIDO NING&Uacute;N INCONVENIENTE Great product for the price.Gave me plenty of space to add videos and music.Works perfectly well with my Galaxy Note Tablet 29.71 G  appeared upon installing. I\\'d say it worked as excepted and wished. 5 stars quality. worth the money there. I ordered this in anticipation of getting my new Galaxy S4. It arrived quickly (long before the phone was is my hands!) and was easy to install. After almost 2 months, I\\'ve had no problems at all so far. I store all my photos and music on it, and it\\'s great not to have to worry about maxing out the phone\\'s native memory. This card has met my every expectation.  I use it for still pictures and video streaming in my Samsung camera, and thus far no problems at all. It is fast and a great deal. You wont need anything bigger than this unless you are downloading tons of movies on your phone. it does its job quite well. Good and fast enough for a car camcorder to write a Full HD video. Used with HP F200 car camcorder. My wife\\'s Verizon Motorola Droid 4 immediately recognized this memory card, mounted and formatted it.  She\\'ll can now store vast amounts of music and photos on her smart phone before she ever runs out of memory with this micro SD card. I got a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 2 and I got this to increase memory. I had hoped to transfer files from my MacBook but it will not recognize the memory card. I need to go to the Apple Genius bar to see if they can figure it out. This card continually unmounted in my S4. It was really painful, when I remounted the card I sometimes retrieved my files, sometimes not. I have to say, though, that a card test in my PC, using Crucial diagnostics, went fine. My gut feel is that the card overheats, and shuts down in the S4, although I have no proof of this. What I do know is that it didn\\'t work for me, and many others (google it). Naturally, Amazon refunded me the purchase cost when I returned the card, gotta love Amazon.I now have a Samsung 64g card, and no problems so far. I like Sandisk, but there\\'s a compatibility problem here with the S4. Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition. Was a little worried about it being the right one because the documentation was skimpy and some people had problem getting 64GB working.No problem! Just slipped it and when I went to settings it recognized it immediately.Nice having the adapter so can move photos and files to my PC when I need it. Not a great deal to say about this. SanDisk is a reputable supplier and it was simply a plug-and-play installation for the phone. It is a memory card and it works. Had to format on my computer because I wanted to use with AOKP and needed to get FAT32, but once done the performance has been excellent :) We bought this for our new camera when we were expecting our first child. We use the camera about once per week (the iphone is just easier and usually takes a better picture for some reason) and we transfer the photos to our PC. It has worked well and we have no complaints so far (7 months). I was taking a tour in Hangzhou China and while I was shooting with my Canon 6D, the card out of sudden crashed. My camera won\\'t recognize the card and it showed \"card reading error\". I had more than 2000 photos in it including the trip in Beijing and Xi\\'an. I was not able to cover those photos even with the common flash memory recovery softwares. I may have to send it to Sandisk subdivision LC Technologies to recover those photos, for the 64 gb they are asking for $325, regardless how much photos they can recover.Lesson learned: for important shoots, use 32 SDHC card, they are so far the most stable SD cards out there. I spent over $10K for this vacation and most of these valuable memories are gone. Thanks a lot Sandisk! I wish I could give negative stars if Amazon allowed me to. i got this instead of the black one because it looked better built than the black one. i\\'m using it with a 8gb stanza sip clip. but the people at Sandisk said to use the black one instead Bought this to go with my Samsung Tab 2 7.0 tablet. Even though the tablet indicates that it can only take up to a 32Gb card. This 64 Gb worked like a charm. Now there is plenty of storage space for videos and music. Recommended I got this for my smartphone after a steep price drop. Pleased that it is working as expected.  No signs of memory failure. I usually buy Sandisk cards, the quality, performance, and reliability are worth the couple extra dollars.  I have had them survive the washer and dryer a few times. With that said, there has been some skepticism related to the serial number of the card as it is displayed on Amazon. I can confirm that I received a brand new 64 Gb card with the serial SDSDQUA-064G-U46A. The card seems fast and it\\'s a huge amount of storage for the price. It has worked flawlessly for a few months in a range of smartphones and cameras. When the price is right on these these memory cards, why not buy for it a late model tablet?  I could  also  make this a review for Class 4 Kingston 32 GB MicroSDHC, which I bought from Amazon at the same time.  The Class 10 cards will work in the late model tablets.  While there might be a small speed boost in booting up and having the tablet ready to run compared to a Class 6 or a lower class card.  I would say it there just isn\\'t that huge of difference between this and lower speed cards.  I would say it\\'s what inside the tablet that will determine it\\'s boot-up speed more than the card you put into it.  In different devices such as cameras that can use this type of card this may very well --not-- be true.  But brand name and cost are the determining factors for what I buy to put in my tablets. My granddaughter wanted this for her phone so she could put songs on it.  She loved the card and its capacity. Love this product. The card easily integrated with my cellphone. Small and very portable. I would gladly recommend this product to my friends. It\\'s tiny,.. in size, - but provides great storage. Tested and works great with all our BlackBerry Z10 - and Q10 devices.. Just remember to format the memorycard by using the Setup on the phone ... and NOT format using your computer.. I love this card. It provides a massive storage boost for my tablet, and has really fast access speeds. I have never run into loading problems, even with very large video files, and am happy with its performance. Not much to say other than it is as advertised and it works. I haven\\'t the means to gauge the transfer speeds but I\\'ve experienced no lags or delays with the combination of this storage and my hardware (Galaxy Note II).The shipping was faster than anything I received recently. Comes formatted in exFAT that is the format that is plug and play with the Samsung Note 2.  After a bit of checking, I found the format should work with the Note 10.1 and 8.No complaints; works perfectly! Unmounts randomly in mu surface pro 2.  Seems to mostly be centered around write operations.  Trying the samsung version which is sadly much more money. shipping was fast,item arrived on time,item is the new ultra high speed(UHS-1) standard of memory card and it works very fast in read and write speeds and watching bluray movies,customer is happy as well just upgraded to more storage.plus i got this for $15.had a class 10 card with 16gb of space.have not see any difference in performance compared to this sandisk ultra 32gb, but the extra space is welcomed. It is amazing how much you can hold on such a tiny disc.  Technology is amazing and this is way cheaper than in the stores. These things average about 50% more mbps than your standard microsd. Worth the premium? IDK. What\\'s your time worth?However I threw a fit and ended up smashing the little guy in half. not too resilient but that\\'s not saying anything about this little guy. The insides look like something out of a Halo video game. high technology. Just go with (2) 16gb\\'s if you have a temper problem and not a huge need for consolidated data. I love this - it expanded the storage of my Nook HD+ (sorry Amazon, I allready had 2 kindles and wanted to see what all the fuss with nook was about- still love my kindles!) from 16 gigs to 80!  Now I have plenty of space for music and movies! Can never go wrong with SanDisk products. You never run into the problem of needing to reformat the disk and I usually store my music on it and plug it into my car instead of carrying an annoying ipod which needs to be synced all the time for new music. With microSD you just drag and drop :) Does its job! Sandisk are the definitive memory products. PERIOD! I have tried to save few bucks here and there and I have lost all the money and all the data. Fristration free package is the simpliest way to get the card in your hand With the smaller electronics we finally are able to save on a card, it has an adapter so it will fit in the larger bays.  There is a lot of storage in such a small space.  I have been looking for the small cards to fit in my pad. Works great! My tablet loves it. I always buy SanDisk products and have never had a problem with any of them. SanDisk SDSDQUA-064G-U46A Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card.  Not much to say about this card other then the fact that it is working well.  My research had me believe that this was a good and fast card and I have no complaints using it in my Galaxy Note 3.Using Samsung\\'s \\'Kies\\' files transfer app on my Mac, I\\'ve had no problems transferring music, videos, docs, and other files to and from this card. I bought this memory chip for a GoPro Hero 3 camera. It works beautifully and it arrived promptly with little packaging. Lotsa space, man. Observed writing speed is between 10MB to 7MB on my dedicated USB2 card reader. I wrote mostly music on it for my Android phone. Speed only matters for faster writing. Slow and expensive- better options out there Using it in a cell phone, and so far no problemsI would recommend this o anyone who needs more memory Works as it should, and has lifetime warranty. In case of malfunction (which I had after several months), Sandisk will send a replacement at no cost. Purchased this item for a LePan TC970 tablet. All I can say is, &#34;Works great!&#34;Okay, and so I have to type 5 more words on this review so that I can post it. SanDisk makes no nonsense great memory. Works perfectly on my S4 and couldn\\'t be happier. I recommend this for sure. Prices on memory go down all the time. This was a good sale price when purchased. SanDisk has always worked flawlessly for me. This was a gift for someone else that needed more memory space on there phone. I hope it works out for them. You just can\\'t beat actual SanDisk quality - DON&#34;T GO FOR THE COUNTERFITS !!This memory Rocks and has worked fantastic for me.Great Purchase ! I have purchased two of these 64gb sd cards and used them in an Android phone, and in a video recorder.After about 3 months usage in my phone, the card would randomly unmount and it took many remounts or reboots to get the card to work again.  Eventually, it stopped accepting writes at all, and couldn\\'t even be formatted... although I could see what was on there.I repurchased the card, and after a couple months, the same thing happened again: random unmounts.  I moved the card to a video recorder, where it worked for a while... but even with a different usage pattern, it died again.I have had no problems with 32GB cards so far.  I\\'m staying away from this generation of 64GB cards.----EDIT----Getting these cards RMA\\'d was quick and easy.  I had a Lexar 128GB SD card die too, and I sent the cards in all at the same time.  I haven\\'t gotten an update from Lexar, but I got updates AND my replacement from SanDisk.  Supposedly there was something fixed in this new card revision.  I hope so. Got this for my cell phone (Motorola Razr M) and it works just fine. hundreds of albums and thousands of pictures and I still have 15 gb of memory left! Great Micro SD access is quick and it works awesome for my phone. The price is also a plus. I would definitely recommend this product. I love this thing, i can store anything on my phone now. I have tons of movies and music now all stored on this SD card. If you don\\'t have one of these and want to be able to store everything youv ever wanted to access via your phone. you NEED to get this. This is my first SanDisk card, I have a bunch of other brands.  I use this one in a tablet.  It works great!  Really love the lifetime warranty that\\'s included. So far so good! I shouldn\\'t run out of room for a long time plays videos great and my camera is plenty fast with this mostly it\\'s going to hold music on my Casio G\\'zOne Commando 4G LTE this works great on all I\\'ve tested and a great price Really fast shipment, I got it within 2 days of ordering. Even faster though was this 64GB microSDXC card. I\\'ve been using it with my Canon T3i DSLR and it\\'s been a big upgrade in storage for my photos. I\\'ve used it for about a month now and it still lives up to its Class 10 speed and reliability. It transfers almost twice as fast as my old 32GB Transcend SD card.The only thing odd was the shipping box it came in... It was the size of a laptop box but inside was an envelope with this SDXC card. Seemed like quite a big environmentally unfriendly waste in packaging! I have a long term positive experience using SanDisk cards. The card works great - both transfer and read speeds. I have now purchased five of these cards over the past few months and my experience continues to be great. I recommend this product. The cars seemed great, but occasionally the card is suddenly &#34;not formatted&#34;, even without writing new data to it. Has happened in multiple devices.I lost some video I can\\'t rerecord on it, and am fairly upset.Some forums say that the early runs of these cards did that occasionally and that it has been fixed on new runs, but I find it difficult to trust them now. I have never had this problem with any SanDisk product before, including the 5 of these cards I have in 32GB.Very disappointed. This card is fast enough to meet my needs on a galaxy note 3. Plenty of memory for my pictures and files. No problems The Nexus One is listed as supporting a maximum of 32GB on an SDCard.Based on  reports here and elsewhere, I took out my 32GB card and put in this 64GB card and powered up the phone.The phone reported that the card was defective in a notification.I pulled down the notifications and tapped the notification that issued that report.  It offered to format the card.I would note that I have Clockwork Recovery and the ROM Manager app installed on my rooted (CM7, Android 2.3) N1.After tapping the notification, the phone formatted the card.  All went well.  Since I had neglected to move my RootExplorer file manager off the SD card prior to putting in the new card, I was not able to check directly on the phonethat the entire 64GB was available.  But, as it turned out, it was.While doing the above, I had been using Winzip to make a copy of the contents of my 32GB card to my PC (using a USB adapter).  When that completed,I powered down the phone and put the new 64GB card in the PC using the Micro SD adapter that came with that card and a USB adapter for that adapter.It showed about 60GB (the usual for a 64GB card, I guess).Interestingly, some files (mainly folders) related to clockworkmod had been placed on the SD card during formatting, which shows where the formatting codeprobably came from.  Take note: if you do *not* have ROM Manager / Clockworkmod on your phone, your mileage may very well vary.  If you have root, I would suggest obtainingROM Manager from Google Play prior to doing the above.  Anyway, I just deleted those files so that they wouldn\\'t conflict with any of the old files I was aboutto copy.I then unzipped the saved contents of my old card onto the new card.Then, I put the new card in the N1 and powered it up.  It worked perfectly, right away.Root Explorer showed about 60GB of capacity (of which about 30 was used by me - I really needed this card!).Tried out Spotify Premium and it played fine from saved files that had been on the old card and were now transferred to the new card.  Other thanRoot Explorer, haven\\'t tried any other apps yet, but am expecting good news based on the experience thus far!I tried a full backup using ROM Manager and it apparently worked without incident.So, based on the above, I would recommend this card for the Nexus One!  What a break to get another 30 GB on an aging phonethat is nonetheless still one of the best phones ever.Caveat: Keep in mind that I just unwrapped this thing and have used it for all of two hours. I believe in generic. I tried generic. for somethings, you need SanDisk. you can trust SanDisk, it always works and if it doesn\\'t, they will make it right. I was looking for a solution to consolidate all the pictures I had on my Lenovo Tablet 2 (comes with built-in 64MB and a Micro-SD reader where I had a 64GB card full). This was a great find and I have not moved all my files to this 128MB card. I don\\'t see any speed issue but did not do a formal test to check the capacity. I like the storage capacity of this little gadget. Purchased for use in my SmartPhone. SanDIsk has shown itself to be a truly reliable and quality storage device company and should do well in years to come.  This 32 GB micro  memory card comes with an adapter so that you can use it for other purposes.  They tend to be a bit on the pricey side, but you can\\'t beat Amazon for pricing.  Go ahead, get one or two of these, they are a worthwhile investment, and you won\\'t be disappointed. Superb! No complains what so ever. I bought this for my Galaxy S4.Pros.-Speed!!!-Comes with the adapter-Lifetime warrantyCons.-None. I ordered a 64 Gig card, and the card received states it is a 64 Gig card, though it only hold 28 Gigs of Data! I got ripped off. I did not check it until after the 30 days had passed. But it appears to be some sort of scam. The card is clearly marked 64 gigs, and I have checked the card in two tablets, and two computers it is only a 32 Gig card.Edit: The company directed me to a tool to reformat this card and I was able to get close to my 64 gigs of data, though I do not like using third party tools. I have Windows, Mac and Linux systems and any of those OS\\'s should have been able to format this card correctly. I will minus a star for having to use a third party tool. Otherwise these are great cards. I have plenty of space for my pics and songs that I store on my SD card. The adaptor helps in easy transfer to my laptop. Bought for my sons GoPro3.  He loves the GoPro, and this accessory is great.  Allows him to film for long stretches, and then he comes in, downloads and edits. My Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD works fine with a 16GB SanDisk card, but the 32GB card died in less than 3 months.  SanDisk will replace the card under warranty, but the SanDisk customer support team informs me that the replacement process takes about a month.  For two months, the card worked flawlessly, and then it started to have intermittent errors.  I thought it might be a problem with my phone, so I tried a 16GB card, and I never had a problem. When I returned to the 32GB card, the intermittent problems returned and got worse.  Eventually the card completely died, and it is no longer recognized by either my phone or my computer-connected card reader.  Both Windows 7 and my phone now act as if no card were inserted even when it\\'s well seated.I plan to update this when I have used my warranty-replacement card for three months, but that will be at least four months from now. I bought this for my daughters Samsung Galaxy Tablet. She wants to play music on it all the time and I don\\'t want the expense of paying for a bunch of downloads. I bought this MicroSDHC and adapter and I can put it in my computers SD port and put music on it from her cd collection. Then all she has to do is put it in her tablet and play as much as she wants. Well, it does work and glad that it is not fake as you would get if you bought from other online stores at $50 a piece. But their max transfer speed is only at 18mb/s not 30 as advertised and I have a very decent desktop with usb3 connector. Very fast and reliable this SD gives my GS4 so much more ability. But I am thinking about buying the 64gb so keep that in mind 32GB will fill up kinda fast if you shoot lost of photos and videos. It arrived on time as schedule. It was purchased on black Friday sale so the price was much cheaper than current listing price. I am now regretting not going with the 64GB as recommended by my coworker.  I purchased it for my new Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone. faster memory i use in note 3 and i dont have problem its faster to transfer information and 64 really gb Um nothing much to really say about it . The adapter for it works but I gave it 3 stars because it goes in n out sometimes What can I say?....speed, quality, good price...I recommend it to everyone. Be aware you need to turn off first on Windows to removed it...is expensive to forget this... Nowadays this memories don\\'t have the fastest write speed, but even tho those are good speeds.On the other hand, SanDisk is a good mark.And, what adds even more value, imo, it\\'s that those specific memory cards have a lifetime warranty.I got one damaged in 1 year, and they changed it.I really like this warranty service. I have this baby in my samsung note2 and there is not much to say except it seems to be working without a flaw Currently using this in my tablet for my retro gaming and it works great. Haven\\'t lost anything and speed works fine. I don\\'t have a negative thing to say it. What else can I say other than the price is right. The quality is out of this earth\\'s modern technology. Pair this baby up with an Android and you got yourself and unstoppable memory machine. Not a good typer or speller :) here is what I didSince I could not format it on my Pc Running WIndows 8 Pro or any of my cellphones running Android versions of 2.3.1 from Republic Wireless :).On my Canon Vixia HF M41 dual card Camrcorder I formated the card but the thing is, it still read as exFATso I mounted it onto my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 anyway and it said something about corrupt files or what ever and it asked If I wanted to format and I press ok and yeap it works now It reads about  54 gigs and some. Got this 64 gig  baby for $19.89 from Amazon Warehouse deals. I bought two but they cancelled one for no stock but it was still showing stock, oh well all I really needed was one I just got greedy. Excelent product as SanDisk has already gotten us used to. It works perfecty with the GoPro Hero 3 speed and, as always, includes the adapter that makes it a very versatile product. Sandisk is the best brand in my oppinion. 32GB is a great size to put music, video etc. Recommend it! This memory combined with the elago mobile nano II USB 2.0 works like a charm. Gives a lot of storage space with great flexibility. It\\'s very cheap, fast tranfers in the right device and the right USB port. I haven\\'t tested static, etc resistant stuff. If anything happens, I\\'ll update I got these as a Deal Of The Day.  I recommend checking those out.  Super price for the 32GB capacity. Great buy and cheaper than most stores. Fits my Galaxy S3 perfect for my music and photos. Fast speed and functionality. I have had no problems with this memory card. Owned it a couple years and transfered it from phone to phone. I know armed with this in my Android tablet and wearing my three wolf tshirt, I will be the envy of all geek girls who will be uncontrollably attracted to my Asian maleness. After using it for a while, I have not issue at all.Have been taking pictures, videos, doing a lot of copy/paste/delete this little 32GB SD card. Not like my other SanDisk 32GB which only last for about 6 months.A small note. Not sure if it is the color or the design, the feel of the card (red/gray) is a little thicker then a regular black SD card. I also need to use little force to get the card out the digital cam. On the bright side, I do not have to worry about dropping the CD card like others since it does not slide out when try getting it out. is everything I need, the best and faster microSD in market, exxecent choice I ordered 2, so I recomended It Definitely needed more memory for my phone.  This is plenty of storage and was purchased at a very affordable price. Everyone need now how you camera, GPS, phone or other gadget can go faster wit a real high speed memory, sometimes we think for example that camera is very slow to recover or open a photo, the GPS spend a lot of time charging a route or your phone game think a lot, using a fast memory reduces a lot all time and battery because the gadget no need spend time charging files. I reformatted it in Disk Utility on my Mac so that is FAT32. And it works very well in my device (Nokia N900). class 10 is about the best there is and SanDisk hasn\\'t let me down, except that one time when a lock/unlock broke off of a 32gig SDHC card I once bought. Well, out of about a hundred different memory cards I\\'de say that ain\\'t a bad run. This works GREAT in my son\\'s/wife\\'s touch pad. If you can get one on sale they are GREAT! when it did work it worked well, one day it just died 3 months after I bought it. I know these thinks happen with any memory card, it happened to me on another card I had, but that is another story. luckily sandisk has decent customer service, and will send me a new card, they were actually easy to work with, I contacted them through email, hopefully all goes well that ends well Bought it for my LG L9 Android phone and in the phone it stayed.  Speed is average.  The problem is that it broke within 8 months with all my data in there. No problems with this micro SD. It works and works again. And then you know what? It works even again I am AMAZED that I can buy 32 GB of nonvolatile memory for so little! Used it in my new Sony HDR-AS15 action camcorder with no problems. Got this for my Sansa ClipZip. It holds all the songs I have on my computer from the cd\\'s I have downloaded. Great to have for extra data when needed. Works great.  Nothing more to say.  You must change this policy, or I won\\'t write any more reviews ever.  y They shipped it out to me right away. Was packaged well and it works very well in my GoPro camera. I was looking for the maximum storage I could add to my SD card slot on my Samsung Galaxy S4. While Samsung only recommends using standard MicroSD cards, this MicroSDXC card works perfectly and offers great speeds. If you need a card to expand your Galaxy S4\\'s storage, this is the go-to card for you. The San Disk Ultra 64 GB Micro memory card works really well. The card is tiny, but the card comes with an adapter. I use it for the GoPro. This microSDHC card makes its job pretty well. It is fast enough to rely your data on any mobile device. Haven\\'t had any complaints so far. You buy a several-hundred-dollars-worth product and then you add up a cheap SD card? What a shame! Go for a Class 10 SanDisk card!! They are very fast and reliable. I use it with my Lumix camera and my brother\\'s just bought it for his Galaxy S4 mini... Great card with fast write times. Excellent for use in DSLR or Gopro camera. I have used it to save both photos and movies. Installed this card in my wife\\'s cel phone.  I would have gone bigger but, that\\'s as big as her phone would take. Added this to my Dell Venue 11 Pro for extra storage space.  I popped the card holder out of my tablet, inserted the memory card and the tablet recognized it right away.  Read/write time is as fast as the SSD drive in my tablet.  No complaints here!! If there is anyone out there curious if this works on Garmin\\'s GPSMAP line of handhelds, then yes! All 32GBs are recognized, and I am maxing this baby out with every map I can get my hands on! No issues at all.Some forums may have you believe there is a 4GB limitation, but there simply isn\\'t (FAT32 - which is the format of the card, has a 4GB limit on FILE SIZE, but that\\'s fine as all individual Garmin maps are under 4GB) This chip replaces my previously fried out offbrand microSD.  So far it has performed flawlessly.  If it fails, I will update the review.  I have a Droid RAZR M smartphone. Worth the $30 I spent here then buying it at the store for $65.  Use it for the Galaxy note 10.1 and the Galaxy Note 2! Whats not to like? It is what it is. I always buy this brand of cards and drives. They have never failed me. I bought this card, originally for my Galaxy Note II, with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader, but I could not get it to format correctly for the phone, even using third party format software.I then tried it in my Galaxy Tab2 7.0plus......same problems.I finally, and ridiculously, put the card in my Nikon D5100 camera. I could take a whopping 8k photos, on high/large settings (not that I would ever need to take that many photos in one session). This was the last option I had, to use the card.It worked well, taking photos of a holiday, and thankfully, it did not fail before I could get my photos onto a computer. Since then, I have inserted it back in the camera, and reformatted (like you always should), and bam, one photo is good, after that, failure, every single time. So now I have a 64GB card, that is capable of taking and storing ONE PHOTO at a time, before I must run a \"fix file system\" on my computer.Don\\'t waste your money on this card, over priced, not really faster than the other cards I have, and zero longevity. This may be a one off, but I think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exFAT, that makes this card a loser, or more to the point, the poor customer who buys it.UPDATE JULY 2012After contacting sandisk, they have offered an RMA, but first they must verify that I have not tried to \"recover\" or \"wipe\" the data on the card, and I must ship it, at my expense, to Taiwan. I have since emailed them in reply to the requested information (date of purchase, photos of the card, packaging ect), and I told them that the data on their is my data, and if I could have accessed the card, I would have wiped it, why should I give them my information, stored on the card? That makes me less than happy, I am guessing that they want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to a company, not knowing who will access it, and what they will do with the information contained? I would have wiped the card, but it was unreadable, unable to format, unable to do anything. I will send it to them, hoping that the information is destroyed, along with the bad card.Sandisk, you are asking a whole lot of your customers, and since this card has gone bad, I have had several other cards from them, go bad as well, seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods. I used to love their products, and their older flash drives are great, still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old, and going strong. I have not had one single microSD card, from this company, last more than three months, since I moved to the Philippines. Either they send their junk to the Philippines, or they have dropped QC from their business model, to create higher profit margins.**UPDATE 2**After emailing Sandisk, and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item, intact, so that they can \"assess\" the card, and look at/recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card, they rescinded. I can only assume that they want to get the card back, to verify that it is bad, or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them, which I can understand. Instead of requiring me to send the card back to them, they asked that I cut the card, and send a photo of the \"destroyed\" card, so they could process a new card, to be sent to me, directly in the Philippines. I hammered them pretty hard in this review, and in the email I sent to them, regarding the bad card, and sometimes, you get results, in this case, I give them 5 stars for doing the right thing. I had no problem cutting the card, since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway, but I did have a problem returning the device, intact, with out knowing what information was stored on the card (banking, amazon account info, passwords, ect.) I would have just kept the card, destroyed it, and never bought another from sandisk. With their faith restoring gesture, I will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid. I just hope that they get better at QC. I returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday, only to find out that you MUST have the original packaging for a replacement. I was lucky to still have one of my packages, but since I bought several of the cards, I am not sure if I gave them the matching package for the card I returned.I would suggest that if you are like me, and have several devices (2 DSLR\\'s, galaxy Tab2, galaxy Note 2, SII, LG-P920), that you find a way to mark each card/package, and keep the package, in the case that the card should go bad. I have had more than half of my sandisk 32gb cards, fail on me, in less than 6 months. I only buy them, because of the cards available in my area, these are the best, which is scary, with such a high failure rate. This has got to be by far the BEST microSD card on the market. It is very fast, was easy to set it up. I am using it in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works flawlessly. Well worth the money. Popped it in my Nvidia Shield and it worked instantly.  Transfers to it are faster than the transfers to the internal storage. I ordered this card as part of a lighning deal back in November. The card was working fine in my galaxy s3 until a few weeks ago where it would intermittently not be recognized by my phone or my desktop computer and today, 4 months later, it died completely. I guess you really do get what you pay for. The price is goodthe looking is nicethe speed is goodit came with an adaptershipping speed is excellentI used it with my Surface Pro & Samsung Galaxy S III, working good on bothThis is a good choice to have :) Responsible seller. Excellent product Nice deal on the 64GB mirosd card. These are ideal for cellphones and the storage space is immense for those like me that need it. Just wish the price was lower for the 128GB ones. expanded the storage space on my 16gb note 2. Check out online to see how to make the phone think its the native space. Fast enough to capture HD video and 8MP photos. Would definitely recommend it! I purchased this item for my Galaxy S3 and it works wonderful.  I have no problems pulling up information and downloading music, movies, and pic! Since my wireless carrier didn\\'t sell a S4 version with more than 16gb of memory, I wanted something to add a bit more storage space to my phone. Got this on sale for $42.99 and I couldn\\'t be happier with how it performs so far. I bought this Memory card because of the Sandisk Reputation and the Class 10 speed, I use this for my Samsung Galaxy Tablet, the Class 10 speed is really impressive! The Memory card can write to memory pictures as fast as you can take them, loading music is almost Instantaneous and a 5 minute Music video loads in about 4 seconds! I highly recommend this for any Tablet or Smartphone with expandable memory Class 10 speed with Sandisk reliability, worth every penny! In real-life use--copying compressed files to and from the card--it clocks in at barely over half the advertised speeds: about 16MB/s read and about 7.5MB/s write, as averaged between testing on several SD slots (some USB-connected, some PCIe-connected) on several computers, plus a just-released smartphone. Very unimpressed by the &#34;up to&#34; marketing of SD card vendors and makers.The actual raw size is also about 59.5GB, which I find fascinating for a flash device, which is only ever manufactured with powers-of-two components. (1KB = 1,024B) Great storage for my android phone, practically unlimited space for music.  Easy to install, and it has been reliable so far. Definitely a class 10 and works as intended, transferred large video files (tv shows and movies) at a rate of 11-13MB/s consistently, played the files I transferred over to my TF700 and the 720p/1080p bluray\\'s played without any problems. UPDATE:This card stopped working as of late February 2013, after only about 2 months of regular use.  There are 492 similar complaints about this card (now 493...) and this is 17.5% of 1 star out of 2918 reviews...  At first I thought it was my phone not being able to find it, or the card would often spontaneously dismount, and there were the frequent and repeated alerts for me to format the card.  Formatting the card only cured the problem for a day or two...  Plugged it into the desktop directly, and the same thing happened.  Got another card of another brand, and everything has been working well since early March 2013 with the other card. So it was not the phone but the card that is at fault.  Very poor longevity. The price is right, but at the end not worth it if you need to buy another card to replace it.  Amazon only covers 30 days..., so consider this a very expensive 60 day experiment if you are willing to try this brand of card...  Would NOT recommend. Best in it\\'s class. Very happy with it, Amazon offered very good price, will recommend to everyone. So, far works with everything i used with. I have used and tested this memory card on GoPro Hero3 Black Edition and everything works great. No problem at all. What can I say? It\\'s a micro SD card I use for a SanDisk Sansa Clip+. It has worked perfectly with no errors. works like a charm...expand my tablet capacity and now I have lots of space for apps, music and videos without worries I got my memory card here instead of on the gopro site and saved some money. Its the same card and it works awesome. This card is about 7 hours of 720 @30 frames per second, or about 4 hours of 720@60 frames or 1080 @30 frames. In a gopro, you will be burning through batteries way before you could ever fill these cards. I prefer more, smaller cards. If a card dies, it is less of a catastrophe and you also dont pay that premium for the larger cards. However, If I do a LONG time lapse with a battery source, having a large card is nice to have. PROS.1.-Bigest memory in a microSD card (64 GB).2.-You have to FORMAT it with a modern device, if not you\\'ll have only 32GB. If you format it with a modern device you\\'ll have 60GB (the 64GB is impossible, or at leats I couldn\\'t).3.-Even if your device says \"maximum microSd memory 32GB\", this memory 64 GB card can works. I tested on Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0, Galaxy SII and SIII, Galaxy Note II (phone), Galaxy Note 10.1 (Tablet) and on all Asus Transformer. It works fast and perfectly in all of them.CONS.1.- Just the price but you already have plenty of offers. I waited patiently and finally I bought it for $49.9 (incredible!) Great price for this card. Lots of other places are charging over $40 each!!! SanDisk is a very safe bet. Haven\\'t heard of any forgeries of these card yet like some other companies\\' cards. 64Gigs give you plenty of room to put LOTS of your music, photos and more on. San Disk makes good cards however i thing the price is somewhat high.So I got the 32GB for half the price so i will have to download my pictures twice a month instead of once a month I can storage a lot on this little thing, lots of videos, lots of pictures. And it\\'s great that I can just take it from my tablet and insert it again on my phone. Also, with a SD adapter, I can place it on my camera and there\\'s no significant speed loss, I mean, I didn\\'t notice anything. Sandisk always do a great job. I have like a year with this memory and works perfects! I recommend it 100% Good value for the money, shipping was a little longer than I expected, but it was worth the wait considering the price.  works great with my go pro hero 3 black edition. The only company capable of making a reliable micro SD at 64 gigs. In all reality they are the only company capable of making a fully reliable SD card period, of any size and type. Despite the Galaxy phone issues, this card has excellent read spead, format speed, and decent write speed. I upgraded from my 32gig SanDisk (that I paid a mere 20 bucks for!) in my smart phone to this and had absolutely no issues.As a complete side note, I\\'m amazed at the capability to fit 64 gigs on a micro SD. I love it. My friend runs a tiny homemade built PC off of a 16 gig Sandisk as the harddrive and it works brilliantly. Very  impressed  with the speed of this 32 GB Micro SDHC. Very good performance for Data Read and Write . This  device was bought  for a  Galaxy Tab 10.1 and  it  works  well with it. The price was  decent and  I  have not  had  any  issue  with the disk. I bought this memory card for my new Samsung Galaxy Note 3 from T-Mobile, and it works perfectly. Turn off the phone, take off the back cover, insert the card, and reassemble. Simple as that, and when I turned the phone on and checked Storage, there was the external microSD card. The phone shows total space on the card as 59.45GB, but I think that\\'s a function of the phone using some space for its housekeeping and not a shortcoming of the card itself.Like the title indicates, no hassles with this memory card. It just does what it\\'s supposed to do. I have used to record video while riding my quad. Usually the battery in my camera dies before I run out of space in this memory card. I got this for my tablet & have used this brand before on other things. It\\'s a reliable brand & I never worry about quality with it. Had no problems at all with this.  I have already purchased 2 more.  I would totally recomment this for storing photos or movies. Simply put, I now have 59.48 GB of extra storage space in my Samsung SGH-1717.  I did not think it was possible because Samsung recommends using a 32GB microsd on this phone.  I tried to re-format this card using my phone just like what the other reviewers mentioned, but, it didn\\'t work.  My phone kept recognizing the microsd card as blank.  However, after using EaseUS Partition Master Home Edition that I downloaded on my PC (yeah, it\\'s free) to convert to FAT32 , it finally worked! SanDisk makes a lot of claims about this card and some of them are questionable. I own two, and while the high-capacity/low-price certainly makes them useful, they\\'re not the answer to all of my recording needs. First of all, do not use this with a GoPro Hero 3 (or later model). Despite SanDisk\\'s claims, these cards cannot handle the demands of true HD recording. GoPro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off. Even with myCanon VIXIA HF10 Flash Memory High Definition Camcorder--technology which is over 10 years old--the SanDisk Ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in FXP mode (1920x1080, 17Mbps) even though the camera says only a class 4 is required. A firmware update to the GoPro \\'fixed\\' the issue for Hero 3 and Hero 3+ cameras, but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards, i.e. lowering the quality of the recording slightly.Those shortcomings aside, the SanDisk Ultra can shoot in XP+ mode (1440 x 1080) on the Vixia HF10 and it works with all of the settings of aContourROAM Waterproof HD 1080P. Is it \"water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof, shock proof\"? I can\\'t say. The ContourROAM is a waterproof camera, so even non-waterproof cards are safe for submersion if they\\'re in the housing. The Ultra has functioned in 10 weather and after being dropped, so there\\'s validity to the claim of it being temperature- and shock-proof. I guess I\\'ll find out whether it\\'s x-ray-proof the next time I go through the airport... I bought two of these for our new telephones. They work fine and were just what we needed if we have extra pictures on the phones. Pictures do take up a lot of room but now we don\\'t have to worry about running out of room. The card works great. Re-formatted in the phone and copied all data to it and re-installed. Works fast and works well. I snagged this for my cell phone. I upgraded from an old 2gb SD card I\\'ve been refusing to replace for the last 4 years. The old card does not specify the class, and it was the cheapest I could get; so I have a feeling it was the slowest . Anywho, I plugged this card in and transferred 27 songs from my PC to phone in about 20 seconds! On my old card that would have taken around 2 minutes. If you haven\\'t upgraded your card, (because you\\'re a cheap miser) like me, you are definitely missing out! Works flawlessly in my Note 10.1 2014 edition. You get a bout 62.5gb usable storage.The only thing I have noticed- and to be fair it is most likely the tablet or the app is a stutter when watching HD movies either downloaded fro Google Play or Samsung Hub [I had to use the free gift cards that came with the tablet for something].I have not noticed any real lag or stutter when using the camera app.$34.95 seems to be a fair price- these were about $100.00 earlier this year. I purchased this primarily for use with the GoPro camera because it doesn\\'t come with one. To my surprise, this mimi disc not only has high memory and speed; it also came with the full size adapter and all for a great price. This Micro SD card really is 64 GB and Class 10.  Too many bogus devices out there, but this is the real McCoy.  Tested with 3 different Android SD Card Testers and they all report Class 9-10 read/write.The only problem is the SD adapter did not work so I had to use another one I had.  Other than that, this is a great Micro SD card at a good price. This product met my expectations.  It was easy to install and works as you would expect it to.  Shipping was fast as usual. Good. I havent come accros any issues with this. Shipping was fast. Well protected. It comes with an adapter as well and a little platic case. Good price. I searched everywhere locally and couldn\\'t find a better price. They work just fine in my Galaxy S4 and Tab 8. It does what it says it will do - unlike most people I know.It also handles very cold temperatures well, too. These sticks have always served me well. This new chip will go in a new Asus Trans. Merry christmas to me. This does just what you need a card to do. We use this one in our Galaxy S4 and she is a strong performer. No complaints and highly satisfied. Works great! very fast too. I bought this for my Galaxy Note 3. Now I can have lots of pictures and movies on my phone. For only $115, it is a pretty good deal. Too bad Iphone and ipads don\\'t have this option. Works perfectly well in my Samsung Galaxy S4 without having to format to do any configuration. A WORD OF WARNING ABOUT THE ADAPTER IT COMES WITH. THE MICRO CARD IS A VERY TIGHT FIT AND CAN BE ARDUOUS IN REMOVING THE MICRO CARD FROM THE ADAPTER! Works great in my android, fast, holds a ton of music and works well. How much can I say about a memory card. :-) I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S3 because I could expand the memory, and this card is how I did it. The phone came with 16 Gb, and this cranked it up to 80 Gb for only about $65 more (buying this much memory already installed would have been much more expensive). I have about a half dozen albums, around 40 or 50 TV episodes, and maybe 16 full length movies on the card, with room to spare - very nice when sitting on a long plane ride! The only problem occurred the day after I put the card in - it gave me an error message, but when I removed and reseated the card, no problem, and none in the months since then. Once I figured out the S3 wasn\\'t liking the exfat file structure and formatted to fat32 it works quite well. I don\\'t know if it\\'s the phone or card and I\\'m not about to test it elsewhere, but I didn\\'t see the 30MB/s speeds. It works good enough for the phone and it\\'s the best option I have for the biggest storage for now.1080P videos with no issues. No problems with read/write stability. Overall I\\'m happy I bought it. Works perfectly in my GoPRo HERO3. Can\\'t ask for more for the price. No issues with the card to date. Used this micro sd card in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  Was watching a video stored on the card while ago when the video quit playing, and the message &#34;Sorry, this file cannot be played&#34; appeared on the screen.  Checked ES File Explorer and found that all the apps, movies, music, etc. I had stored on the micro sd card were gone.  The card was apparently totally blank.  Inserted the card in my desktop computer, and the computer said that the card had to be reformatted before it could be used.  Tried to reformat it to NTFS, ex-fat, and fat32. Each time the computer said it was unable to complete operation.  Guess this card is dead after a little over 4 months.... It worked great in my Samsung Galaxy S3, and then failed after 3 months.  Have tried contacting Samsung via their warranty form on their website and I am not having any luck.  I gave up and bought a different 32GB card from NewEgg.com hopefully that one lasts longer. Nice 32gb micro sd card. Using one in a Samsung S3 and another one in a Samsung S3 mini. Both phones can use the full storage amount and read/write seems fast. Comes with a nice little micro sd to sd adapter for easy use on a laptop for transferring files. I installed this in my phone to take advantage of extra space for downloaded movies and games. Seems fast, cool. I went to update my Garmin GPS with the latest maps and it told me that the entire map wouldn\\'t fit (US, Canada and Mexico). It said I could put the maps on an SD card to get the whole map set or else I had to pick only a portion of the lower 48 states (it wouldn\\'t even fit the entire US only). t don\\'t understand why as everything fit before.So, I picked up this SD card for the unit and it worked perfect. I now have the entire map set on the GPS. I just have to always leave the SD card in the unit which for me, isn\\'t a big deal as I wasn\\'t using the SD card for anything else before. My SD card showed only a little more than 29 GB available for my 32 GB card.  That\\'s the bare minimum I\\'ll accept without sending it back.  I\\'m normally happy with the brand name SD cards I buy on Amazon, though.  For the price I paid for this particular card, my expectations were higher. I got my wife a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 for Christmas, and it took awhile for her to start figuring out all the things it can do.  Once she did, that led, of course, to her wanting to watch movies on it.  That was my signal to spring into action, that is, if I wanted to prevent her from running wild, buying \"digital copies\" of every movie we already have in DVD or Blu-Ray.  You can\\'t play DVD or Blu-Ray movies on this device, but you CAN use your computer\\'s DVD or Blu-Ray drive and commonplace third-party software to convert movies in this format into \".mp4\" and/or several other types of video files that CAN be played on this tablet.Since this particular tablet is capable of playing high-definition video (screen resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels), and we want to use ALL of that high-def capability, my conversion files tend to be pretty large (average 5 to 10GB per movie) ... way too big to be stored on the tablet\\'s limited internal memory.  That\\'s where the tablet\\'s microSD slot ... and this SanDisk flash memory ... comes in.  I make HUGE mp4\\'s, store them separately on a 1.5 terabyte drive, and then load as many of them as I can on this chip, which shows up in the tablet as a separate memory source.  Then all you have to do is pull up one of the movie files from the card, and hit play.  You can use the device\\'s standard video player, or get an app with more controls.Watching high-def video on a tablet that\\'s streaming the data from a memory card (rather than the tablet\\'s internal memory) requires a memory card with very high \"read speed,\" and this SanDisk card\\'s \"Class 10\" rating fills that bill.  That\\'s the difference between cheaper microSD that\\'s primarily designed for simple data storage, and microSD that\\'s designed for higher active transfer/read speeds.  The \"Class 10\" designation generally means that the subject card will transfer data at a MINIMUM rate of 10MB per second.  This SanDisk \"Ultra\" card is capable of transferring data at speeds of up to 30MB per second, depending on the speed of the device you\\'re using it in, and other particulars of the way you\\'re using the device.\"Frustration free packaging\" means the chip, SD adapter, and plastic case comes in a little, sealed cardboard envelope with a pull tab opener.  This card comes pre-formatted for Android, and my use of it in the Galaxy Tab 3 for watching high-def .mp4 movies has thus far been flawless.Finally, don\\'t let yourself get burned by counterfeiters in trying to save a buck.  While pricing on memory tends to fluctuate, Amazon\\'s current pricing on this card is VERY competitive with any/all vendors out there selling GENUINE SanDisk \"Ultra\" memory.  Buy from Amazon, or other trustworthy vendor, because I just learned the hard way that these memory cards are being counterfeited in huge numbers ... that is, the counterfeiters are placing SanDisk labeling/packaging on inferior, generic microSD, and selling the bogus chips on Ebay and anywhere else they can.  I bought THREE from Amazon after I got burned by a Chinese seller on Ebay.  The counterfeit packaging and labeling was good enough to fool me, until I actually tried one of the chips in the Galaxy Tab 3 ... the write speed (that is, the amount of time it takes to transfer files ONTO the microSD card) was dramatically worse than the speed of a genuine SanDisk \"Ultra\" card, and the read speed was totally inadequate for playing movies on the Galaxy Tab 3.  I may never have figured it out at all if I didn\\'t already have one other, genuine SanDisk \"Ultra\" with which to compare the fakes.If you want the best, most reliable memory for the microSD slot on your shiny, new Android device, look no further ... this is it. ... Got this to use in the Cobra dashcam. The cam came with a card but it was very small and seemed to have one or two glitches on playback.The SanDisk card is big, no glitches, and is a great price! ... Mark Sandisk seems to be the most reliable for me. Not only a good product, but good prices. Always good memory cards. Period. This card had rave reviews, so I decided to get it to use it with my new GoPro Hero3 camera.  I liked that it had a high capacity and it was class 10 which would allow me to maximize the features of my camera.  As soon as it arrived I popped it in to the camera for a quick test run and after it was successful I then packed it in my luggage for a snorkeling trip.  3 days into taking awesome footage with my camera this SD card started resulting in SD card errors which made my data unrecoverable.  Fortunately I still had some time in my trip to go get a different memory card with better reliability. These memory cards appear to be hit or miss, and in my case it was a miss.  I can not recommend this card for purchase.  It appears that this company has a problem with the Quality Control process, and you can see that reviews are either overwhelmingly positive or as is my case, 1 star/negative.  It looks as though they just accept a certain amount of faulty memory cards.  Unfortunately for me, I missed the window to return this card because I was travelling, and I am stuck with a useless micro SD card.  I\\'ve had better luck with Kingston, and Transcend brands. Lexar and Samsung have also served me well in the past.  I will no longer purchase any other SanDisk products and I wouldn\\'t recommend that you would either, but if your are swayed by the reviews, make sure you thoroughly test what you purchase before you actually need it. Great price delivered to my front door what more could you ask for. Access speeds are quick enough for my phone (note 3), have had no issues thus far. Sandisk finally admits that defective micro sd cards cause battery failure in the galaxy s3. I had  mine about six months before it failed completely. I submitted complaint to sandisk and await their response. Downloaded eraseUS and formatted to fat32 with 32k clusters.  Mounted to either 7 or 10 with no problem, see nada instability.  But that\\'s not the coool thing.  I actually have two of these.  One is in the sd slot, one is in the power port via the samsung sd/usb adapter.  Soooo, my 16g 10 is actually a 145gb 10.  I can\\'t imagine what I will actually do with all that, but I have it.  Maybe run a Linux port and web server (just because I can).  Too bad about that external storage limit on iOS.... Plenty of extra storage can load a lot of movies in high definition, music and a boat load of other stuff. Nice addition for a Roku player or tablet. I believe this came with a SD adapter, so you can plug it into an SD card slot on your computer or other SD device. Got it on time, and I haven\\'t had any issues at all. I got if for my Samsung 10.1 note and there is by far plently of space left. I have not pushed this card by writing and reading tons of video or anything, but it seems to work fine. Works great with the galaxy note 3 I didn\\'t have to do anything but just pop it in the phone and the phone did the rest. Works Perfectly!!!  Couldn\\'t ask for a better card and price was good too. got two one for each smart phone and my Wife loves hers too finaly got lots of free space.SanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter... Great capacity and never had to reformat it, blue tooth transfers work great from previous phone to this memory card. I bought this for my new Galaxy III and I have to say that it is super fast at loading up when I insert it and I have had no problems with it or glitches so far. I got it as a deal of the day and it was a bargain!! I have tried different SD cards in a Grpro Hero3 black edition, as it can record from 4k downwards none of my other cards had been able to use the full range, the recording stops after few seconds.This card make me record 4k, 2.7k, 1080 etc. different fps until the card is full or battery runs empty.Maybe i\\'m lucky, lots people said sandisk always giving them freezing and problems but i still go for it and i never had any problem. I liked this so much that I bought a 2nd here.  The first I put in my Samsung Galaxy Player 5 and the second in my Samsung Galaxy S 4G phone.  The card easily hold all my mp3s and apps.  This card is noticeably faster than the cheaper cards that have a speed of 4 on them...this card is a 10 and when you first boot your device you see all your apps get loaded within seconds.  If you want a good 32 GB mini SD card then this is the one! it works as intended.  don\\'t notice the difference from other memory cards. (only typing this to meet minimum words required) I have used my memory cards for shooting video with GoPro cameras and pictures with my Canon Digital SLR.  I have never had an issue and continue to use these memory cards in all of my cameras. Good purchase and I am satisfied with this card. Would definitely purchase another one. I would advise everyone to purchase this one. No problems! Needed this to put into my new tablet. This is exactly as described and works great no complaints . would recommend to others and the price was good too. Easy to use.non stick and bulit well.would buy again no question.hope it last longer than the last.only issue is it\\'s longevity.Last one lasted less than 3 years.for that price it should last longer What they charge at retailers for SD Cards is ridiculous.  I always order via Amazon, and never a dissapointment!  Great SD Card, works great, as expected. great and holds more than anticipated, just love it.  My granddaughter loves it because she can put all of her music on it These are such great tiny things and hold so much on my tablet and smartphone.  Love them so much, I just got a 32 GB one. You can\\'t go wrong with Sandisk.  I use their products in my tablets, cameras, and flash drive applications.  I have yet to have a bad product from Sandisk.  I use this 32GB Micro SD in my cell phone and it comes up fast and reliable.  I am a happy camper--the price was right too! This works with my Galaxy Note 2. The phone recognizes it and it reads 59.47gb available. Very sturdy card fits perfectly comes with the adapter. Once you place it in your device it is best to format the card so the device can read it. You also want the class 10 rating. Bought it for my Galaxy Note 2. Add tons of storage to my phone. Now I can store video and songs. Very good price for a card more than necessary. Excellent quality, works at high speed and maintaining the data faithfully got this to expand my memory in my Samsung tablet  it increased my ability to store more photos.  good purchase I\\'ve had this card for over a year, and it has worked great as a backup storage source for our digital camcorder (1080p/60).  It seems to keep up just fine, and functions perfectly.The only (albeit minor) nit is that the microSDHC to SDHC adapter seems to not work in all card readers.  I\\'m not sure why, but it wasn\\'t worth removing a star for that. We ordered these and used them in my Galaxy Note 2 and my wife\\'s Razr M. After a few months we noticed that they would cause the phone to freeze up. The phones would start showing that it was mounting and unmounting the SD card early on but toward the end they just froze up the phone. Once we trashed the cards, the phones worked fine. We bought a different brand and no trouble since. I don\\'t know why these red & gray ones have issues but stay away from them. Put it in a family members android phone and have had zero issues...exactly what you would expect from this type of product Bought this for my Android Phone/Tablet - love it, 32GB is a ton of storage and being Class UHS-I it\\'s FAST Purchased this a few months ago and the product is still working well. I haven\\'t had any data loss or other issues. I got this card to supplement the built in 32GB in my Galaxy Note 3.  This card provides superb internal xfer speed on the phone as well as to the PC using the Note 3\\'s USB 3.0 port. Hard to say much about a memory card other than it works as expected, since it\\'s class 10 it\\'s fast, since it\\'s 32GB is has plenty of space for music, pictures, and videos. Bought it, installed it in my Droid RazrM never removed it and it died at a little over 6 months now. Did not store apps or anything. just pictures and video from the phone. I bought a Gopro and couldn\\'t record anything because I didn\\'t have a MicroSDHC Class 10 memory card.Now I do - Problem solved.Therefore, 5 stars! I bought this with my GoPro+ Black Edition. I\\'ve been using the product for a little over a month. I don\\'t have a lot of experience with different Micro SD\\'s as this is the only product that I own right now that uses MicroSD. It does exactly what it is supposed to so far: stay out of the way. I rarely even think about it because it just works. I have this in my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and love it. It houses all of my music and pictures without issue. It does seem like R/W speed is a bit slow, but really can\\'t complain. This is a solid card that I use in my GoPro. It holds the data and the read write speeds are impressive. Works, I have a few movies and songs saved to it to play on my tablet and I love it. If you look through the reviews you will see that this card seems to have both a failure rate and a incompatibility with some devices. I bought this card in November of 2012 and it worked great for a while. The card started failing in my Galaxy Note 2 in the beginning of January. After reformatting and trying the card in other devices it still does not work. Please understand that this is not a user error but appear to be something wrong with the card itself. I have tried the card in 3 different phones. 1 with stock Jelly Bean, 1 with Ice Cream Sandwich, and 1 with a Cyanogenmod custom firmware. All 3 devices have problems and say \"blank sd card\" or \"unsupported filesystem\". Even formatting the card in both Windows and using Android do not seem to fix the issue. I was happy to find such a good price on a large microsd card but sadly it looks like you get what you pay for. It does appear that some people are having luck so it might be worth a gamble of $20 if you are feeling lucky. If you do buy this card it would be wise to double check your backup process to make sure you do not lose pictures or videos if you have this problem. I am glad I used dropbox for my phone so I did not lose any pictures or videos. with games being 1-2 gb now a days this card is great for storing all my high graphic games on my note 2 and with the extsd2intsd mod it all goes to my sd card, but thinks its my internal storage which is exactly what i needed. I don\\'t know why I bought this but I\\'m glad I did. 32gb would of been just as good. I bought this considering I have a huge iTunes collection of about 28gb and would increase pass the 32gb so I bought the 64. Problem is since I have a playstation plus account I bought a Sony music unlimited at a reduced price of 12 bucks. Which left me having pretty much my entire music catalog in the palm of my hard without me wasting a single gb of memory. I still love the product and does work would definitely recommend. Not a bad product at all. I got it for my blackberry Z-10. I had to format it through the phone\\'s software, but afterwards it worked like a charm. A couple months on and no problems. Class 10 and 64 gig, so I have no complaints. Only reason I didn\\'t give 5 stars is because it isn\\'t particularly outstanding in any way, but it is a pretty simple product. Does the job, no problems, good to go. I can\\'t believe 32gb fits in such a small space. It blows my mind. My first computer only had half a gb for a hard drive and was the size of a book. What is this sorcery!?! This product has served me well for the last two months.  It has a lot of storage and it was reasonably priced. I bought the SanDisk Ultra 64 GB for my new Samsung Galaxy S4. Being that it\\'s the faster type of memory I like to think it reads and writes fast. And I feel like it does, but it\\'s in my phone so who knows. Now for your highend DSLR you\\'ll notice a difference and be very pleased. This card is extremely fast. In order to leverage its full capability your card reader and device must support UHS-I. However it is also very fast with class 10 devices. It came in an easy-to-open package, I installed right away to my new Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition, and works great! It fit, and it appears to workI have not yet had ANY issues with this cardhowever, I have only been using it for a few weeks...so my comment is based on my experience thus farIf my position changes, I will delete this postso, if you are reading this, then no problems has occurred thus far Super low price for expanding the storage for your BN HD+ Nook. Buy the 16GB version & save money, then spend a few bucks on this microSD card & double your storage. Use the adapter to easily pop into your laptop or PC and easily transfer files when you are on the go. Better yet, buy two. Works fine for recording HD video. Copying movies off is fast. Sandisk quality has failed me. Moving on to another brand. I\\'ve had three of these memory cards fail on me in very short order. I ordered this card for a friend and had it shipped with prime. After about a week my friend still didn\\'t have the card. OK, I called Amazon and they had a new card in the mail that day and overnight-ed it. Great service on Amazon\\'s part!It\\'s a micro SD card, what more can you say about it. If you don\\'t know how to use one then you are just dumb and you should walk into traffic Got this to shoot in HD. It is working really well so far. It is handling HD recording and playback great. I know after I buy SanDisk I can be confident that I have a fast and reliable product. Has worked great in my netbook for a few minutes now This card was able to transfer all my pictures, movies, music, and toast from my hard drive to my cell phone very fast. Although, I don\\'t necessarily believe that you need the fastest card for your cell phone, if you can afford it, I would get it. Having a snappy cell phone being able to process and write to an SD card extremely fast makes you happy. I bought a pair of these during Amazon\\'s cyber Monday sale ($38.98 ea!).  One is working great in my Galaxy S3 (synched around 40 songs/minute using MediaMonkey in MTP mode) and the other I was going to use with the SD adapter as a backup for my DSLR, but after doing a long 1080p video test with no issues, I made it my primary card and sent my old 32gb SDHC to the bottom of the camera bag. dont need any extra cards now! I could let this thing bang around in a pocket full of keys and coins (accidentally of course) and still come out working great. SanDisk makes great SD, SDHC, and MicroSDHC products and this is one of them. Affordable and easy to use storage, this also CAME with the SD Card Adapter.I\\'ve used this to move pictures and files onto my Chromebook with ease. Price was spot on where it should be ($24.99) so less than $1/GB for storage...nice. Solid design, easy to mount, recognized the card immediately in my Samsung Galaxy II Tablet, never had any errors, and the read/write speeds have been amazingly fast. I loved this card. well worth the $Good size tooIf anyone has any questions about this please dont be afraid to ask me.Id be more than happy to answer any and all of them. I use this for many technological devices and it works like a charm.I ACTUALLY DO GET CLASS 10 SPEED ABOUT 99.8 OF THE TIMES LITERALLY..................THE OTHER .2 IS PROBABLY RELATED TO READ/WRITE SPEED.........and let me remind you as I said earlier.MANY PLATFORMS FROM TABLETS,SAMSUNG GALAXY S3,S4,CAMERAS,PC,ECT..............WORKS LIKE A CHARM GOOD JOB SANDISK!!!!!!!!!YOU DID NOT LET ME DOWN.......... Bought this as a replacement for another 64gb micro sd card I had for about two years before it died on me a few days ago. No issues with this as of yet. Loaded up just fine read and write speeds seem fine as I was able to transfer over 27gbs of data in a few minutes. Using it in a Note 3 with no issues. It does what is expectected. I bougth it to use with my GoPro and it works perfectly! I recommend it! That card was in very special offer, and I kept a couple of them.So fast and affordable, what I have to say more: it\\'s a SanDisk! a very nice addition to my note 8 inch wifi!, excellent, know this brand as it is the same that I use in my camera nikon d7000, so I\\'m very happy with this unit memory, it gives me more flexibility, and class-ten to be very quick. I\\'ve just plugged and play on my Galaxy S3.It is very cheap for extra 64 Gb. (If you want the same on an i-phone, you\\'ll pay US$ 100 per 16 Gb, with a 2 year contract with your carrier).I do not remember the last time I downloaded the pictures to my PC...I took hundreds of 8MP pictures and a bunch of full HD videos, I have around 30.000 mp3 and I still have space.I just love it! Bought this one to add to the standard one i had already purchased for the size and speed and price it was worth it I wanted one of these badly, in fact I ordered two. Aside from someone stealing the first package they sent me, I am glad I could just go on amazon, see the super cheap price and have it delivered in 2 days, which is quicker than I could go and get one living here in NYC.  Now I have tons of stuff I can quickly load onto it and put into my Asus Transformer t700 instead of waiting for the super slow usb cable transfer directly to the tablet.  The other one I put in my Galaxy S4, which is sheer overkill but I dont have to worry about running out of space File system as shipped might not be appropriate for all phones but just stick it in and format it in the phone and you are good to go. Works great with excellent speeds formatted as FAT32 with a new Samsung Galaxy Note 2! This memory let\\'s me load most larger game apps (with GL to SD) and media files off the main internal memory. Very fast! Package arrived before estimated time (well Done). Installed in Galexy Optimus Pro and was recognized immediately. Is working well expanding room for pics and apps. Lots of storage space for my phone lets me have lots of music and roms.  Can\\'t live without this card. A lot of memories. Works fine with my gopro camera. I thought it was a little expensive but when I see the real price on a store, totally change my mind! I\\'ve tried memory cards with really bad results. Finally decided to go with Sandisk. It may be a little bit more expensive than the others, but ultimately this is more reliable. I bought this and after a month of use on my Samsung Galaxy s2 it failed and could no longer be seen, and when i contacted support they said that i had to send it to them to get replaced which is more expensive than buying a new one SanDisk is a great product all around.  I bought this for my son\\'s Samsung Galaxy Tab and it fit perfectly.  We\\'ve thrown about three movies on there already and I\\'m planning on adding a couple more.  I would definitely guy from them again. Works great in my Samsung Galaxy S4, no problems, good speeds. Price was right, couldn\\'t go wrong. Also have tested in my GoPro and also works well. I bought two of these at different times.  Both of them had the retail packaging with the Android on them and the model number matched the packaging.The first one was 32GB.  I tested this out with dd on my built-in SD card reader on my MBP and on a GFR204SD USB device and couldn\\'t get more than 8 MB/s average write speed.  Would bounce up and down between 6 and 10.  The Class speed is supposed to be the minimum, not the maximum.  R/W off the HDD was above 20, so that wasn\\'t the bottleneck. Neither is UHS compliant, but I should at least be able to get the Class 10 rating out of this.  Read @ 30 MB/s is pretty accurate.The second one (64GB) I tested by just watching Activity monitor to see if it was in the ballpark.  Bounced between 8 and 10 copying from a hard drive or a RAM disk.  Sounds like probably Class 10.  Read speed to RAM disk was about 24 MB/s. I use this in my Samsung Galaxy S3. It\\'s spacious and holds a large chunk of my music library, so I\\'m happy. Haven\\'t had any stability problems, and it seems to be reasonably fast for my purposes. No complaints. I bought this for my Samsung Tab 3, my pc, camera and cell phone. It is a great little drive to store music or files on. The price was excellent as well. Fast shipping, packed well. great deal all the way around. I recently switched over from an iPhone to a S4 and I\\'m trying to get used to the lack of on board memory.  This card works well for me because most of my memory is used on pictures.  I\\'m still working my way around the actual phone and memory, but this serves me well. Bought two, one for wife and one for self.  Great price and fills the bill.  Great expanded memory for my Samsung G-III andoid. I bought 2 of these, 1 to use in a StealthCam(with the included adapter) and 1 to use in my tablet(an Acer A500).  So far the card has worked flawlessly for both applications.  I chose to use the microSD card to make it possible to copy the pictures from my trail cameras using my tablet in the woods.  Removes the need for a dedicated viewer or to tote a laptop or extra cards. Happy to have gotten this for a steal price! Definitely a lot of space than I need for my gopro or DSLR camera, but more is so much better than less! Got one for my wife\\'s S3 and it works perfect.  The frustration free packaging is nice so I can just open the package and get right to the product.  Didn\\'t have to do anything special...just put it in the S3 and worked immediately with no issues. Got this for my Samsung 3.  After 4 months, was no longer accessible - first message I got on the phone was that there was an unformatted Sd card installed.  Next, it wouldn\\'t even recognize the card was in there.  I inserted a different card, and the phone was able to recognize it and play music off it - - so, not the phone.  I also tried having my desktop read the card - - no go there either.... I do not know if the GS3\\'s have issues with reading cards of this size but I eventually had to remove this card and purchase a Transcend 8GB Class 10 card just to check if it was my phone that was the problem. When I got it I opened the packet, and popped it right in. Recognized, was able to start using, taking shots and video and they immediately saved to the card without the hangup my old class 2 card used to have. After a couple of days I noticed that I would take a shot and the phone would give me an error that it could not save to the SD card. You would have to reboot to fix. When scrolling through the gallery on the SD card it would freeze and the app would crash. I moved what I could, formatted the card but the same thing kept happening.Since installing the new Transcend 8GB card I\\'ve had no such issues. Maybe its just MY phone but I think there have been enough complaints from GS3 owners to be a little skeptical about this card on their phones. I carry a ton of digital content with me on my phone and never want to run out of space.  This is a very fast Micro SD Card and gives me 75 GB of usable space on my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  I can take 20 pictures in about 5 seconds while listening to music.Fast, efficient and tons of storage ... who can ask for more!BillH Purchased based on the recommendation from a reviewer of a dash Camera also purchased here. No issues at all just works. I\\'ve had a couple of these crap out on me but so far this one is my first heavy duty one. It\\'s very fast and responsive. I just hope it can last better than some of the others I\\'ve had. I have always used SanDisk products but this was a disappointment. It totally failed in my Galaxy S3 after about 8 months. I will order another brand but no more SanDisk for me! What more can be said, is great. It works fast and never unmounts randomly. I use it to bump music between a samsung gs3, note 3, tab 3 8\", and a tab 3 10.1\" and it always works. I would suggest it to anyone for the price. Another nice thing is the color makes it easier to find when dropped. What can you say? So far it remembers everything it&#8217;s told. No sign of Alzheimer&#8217;s to date. So far I have not seen it stare into space or talk about when it was a child or complain about how different the music is from when it first started storing music or say how much data has changed from back in the day&#8230;&#8230;. Nope, still young and pretty fast, no arthritis in the bits or bytes, Bought two, one for me and one for my husband.  Works great.  Feels good to have a lot of space on my smart phone to save pictures, movies taken, etc. I paid less than $60 shipped to my door. Had it for 2mth and have had no problems after formatting it to FAT32... and its as fast as my internal  memory in my note 2. This is a high quality easy to use product. Ready to insert and go! No problems with capacity or packaging. Didn\\'t expect any problems and didn\\'t have any either.  Great SanDisk quality at a decent price.  Speed as rated.  Happy Very satisfied with the speed and the space on this little guy.NOTE: you need to format this on a Cellphone that can be capable of using micro sd xc or on a card reader that is compatible with sd xc because if you do not do that you will only see it as a 32gb. (i got a couple of errors because i had formatted first on a computer with a SD HC reader NOT XC. But now it is working fine. I bought this for my surface rt tablet and it works great, and love how it came with the adapter. Recently I bought a Microsoft Surface RT tablet and used the 32GB version of this memory card. Worked great and I didn\\'t have any problems. So, when I heard that the Surface RT could be expanded to 64GB, I immediately looked for a great deal online. Behold... Amazon offered this card for under $50 AND it was Prime eligible! Woo-Hoo! To me, it was a &#34;no-brainer&#34; and I quickly ordered this inexpensive upgrade. Like its predecessor, it comes with the memory card, an SD card adapter, and a small plastic case. installing the card is super easy on the Surface, because you just line it up with the slot and push it in till it clicks! That\\'s it! No formatting required and the card runs quite fast! Normally, I buy SanDisk Extreme memory cards (which are faster), but this particular card had no problem running video files or playing music.Anyway, if you get this card for your Surface RT tablet, DON\\'T format it! Why? Well, the card is already formatted, so why risk messing up your card? Just pop it in and enjoy greater space on your Surface!Note: As far as I know, you cannot install Surface apps onto the memory card, only media files and documents. Still, this card is a great upgrade and I highly recommend it! I got the This memory card as a gift, to use it with my new ContourRoam2 camera, which according to a lot of users it shouldn\\'t/wouldn\\'t work with the camera. Even the technical team from Contour told me they are not optimistic that Ultra memories from SanDisk work their camera. Still It did for me! great product at an affordable price!  there\\'s just no messing with sandisk quality, and with 64 gigs you\\'ll have plenty of room to store anything and everything you want! I formatted this card as NTFS...loaded it up with a bunch of my kids\\' favorite movie and TV shows. Transfers seem to be pretty speedy, even while playing HD content. This card has met my requirements. I wanted a 32 GB card with an adapter and I wanted the faster card and it is a C10. It worked out of the box with no problem. I bought 2 of them at the same time, one for mine and one for my wife\\'s Smartphone--Samsung Galaxy Centura. I am satisfied with both of them. I\\'m a light user. I don\\'t store a lot of media on my phone, and don\\'t play a lot of games or watch a lot videos. I keep my media on here (music, photos, docs, etc), and backups. I don\\'t notice much of a lag. Any lag I do notice (maybe every couple of months) I attribute to the phone, not the card. A shutdown and re-start usually solves that. Great to have, and way more space than I\\'ll ever use. If you\\'re not a heavy user, you may not need this much storage space, but for about $20, why not just get it and know you\\'ll never run out of space. It worked for a while, I purchased 4 of them, then they just started dying.....one by one, none no longer work. perfect just as described Sandisk is the best & moist reliable memory card out there. Perfect fit for my new Galaxy Note 3 smartphone ! good storage I placed his SanDisk 64GB Micro SDXC card in my Galaxy S5 phone.  My phone &#34;sees&#34; the card and tells me that the card has 64GB of space available.  So far, so good! - I\\'ll update this review if the card stops working! I searched for an inexpensive 64 GB micoSDXC card for my new Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (32GB) tablet and this one caught my eyes regarding positive comments and price. The Note was a Christmas gift and it will be used for media entertainment while on business travel and as a replacement for an aging Toshiba Notebook. There were no problems with the install ... the card was recognized upon boot-up after the installation. I don\\'t require great transfer speeds for my tasks. A quick test using ES File Explorer copying a 400 MB media file from the tablet OS card to this expansion card yielded 10 MB/s write and 40+ MB/s read speed, which is more than sufficient for all my tasks. As a bonus, I added this card to my shopping cart at $46.99 and the following day the price dropped to $37.99. That was all the incentive needed to push the &#34;Place your Order&#34; button. I can\\'t speak much of reliability since I\\'ve had the card installed for less than two weeks. So far it has been stable. Excellent product, High capacity, well made.  Holds many pics, movies, and music...a gift to the camera buff.  I\\'ve always wanted a hi-capacity item by SanDisk. I got this card only a few months ago, used it on a Note 3, now it has failed. No matter what I try, attempts to format the drive or edit the files on it, whether using my computer or the phone, have all failed. The card\\'s data is now essentially read-only, which is the only saving grace of this since I could at least save my data.Previous to this I had an issue with it corrupting photos randomly, with increasing regularity as it grew closer to complete failure. I am now going to be avoiding SanDisk when possible I bought this for my Lumia 1520 Windows Phone to supplement the onboard storage capacity. Fits fine, works great, fast access, immediately recognized by the device. Not much more you can ask of a microSD card. I personally got mine to expand my Surface storage and it works brilliantly, it holds all of my media: movies, tv, books, and pictures; with plenty of room to spare. I ordered this to use with my new Samsung Galaxy SII phone.  I\\'ve used SanDisk in the past and have always had great luck with their products. I would definitely recommend this product. I inserted this into my Galaxy Note, powered the phone on and went into storage. I pressed on \\'mount sd card\\' it said it didn\\'t understand the filesystem and asked if I wanted to format it. I did and then I saw 59 gigs of free space.Works great and got it for 43 bucks off Amazon.Con:It\\'s extremely slow to write to. If I try to write a 3gb file from my PC to the card it takes about 26 minutes (2MB a sec). If I write to the internal SD card on my phone it writes at 10MB a sec. I don\\'t understand why it\\'s that slow. I can accept that it will be slower than an internal SD however I didn\\'t know it would be dog slow. My 32GB samsung micro sd was much faster... Good fast and inexpensive microSD - noticeably faster for most tasks than the class 4\\'s that are hanging around. So useful for when you don\\'t have access to your cloud storage. Not much to say about this except it works great.  The R/W speed never seems to slow down photo or movie taking.  32 GB doubled the capacity of my tablet so I won\\'t reach the capacity for a long time. This 32GB microSDHC card replaces a 16GB card.  Ordering was easy, the price was good and the product arrived well packaged and fully functional. Is there any thing else that needs to be said?This was put into a Samsung S3. The card worked and has worked so far w/o any hick-ups. Price was very good too here on amazon. Works as expected, at a great price! I install in a GoPro Hero3+ and have no problems recording or playing back video. Got this for the Galaxy S4.  Works great.  No complaints and I highly recommend to all....32GB is perfect if you take a lot of pics and video\\'s... Over the years, I\\'ve found SanDisk memory to be durable and reliable. This 16 GB Class 10 card appears to be no exception. So far, it\\'s performed well. I especially appreciate the fast write speed. For the money, it\\'s a good deal. I\\'m still stuck 10 years ago when microSD cards were fairly new. They were and still are neat - its amazing at how much you can put on something that is literally the size of a fingernail! I purchased this Class 10 64Gig exclusively for use with myGoPro HERO3: Black Editionso that the card can keep up when the camera is recording HD at 60fps. Its amazing how many people aren\\'t aware of the classes of these data cards and how it can affect performance and capturing of video and even stills. If you have tried capturing video only for it to shut off automatically, it may be because your memory isn\\'t fast enough to keep up. But you\\'ll have no problems keeping up with this card nor should you have problems storing it all! This SanDisk memory often gets labeled \"the best of the cheap memory\" but I\\'m unsure how the expensive, poor memory does - why would anyone buy anything else more expensive?! This is the card to get! It\\'s so good, I\\'ve also purchase two 32Gig cards for our Samsung S4\\'s! I\\'ve been using this card for over 2 months and it works perfectly. I installed it in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it was immediately recognized. No need for formatting or other special handling. The item arrived in perfect shape and even included a sd adapter if you need it.  The card has worked just fine for me so far, so I have not complaints. I had it for a day before it died and lost all my data. Not what I expected from SanDisk or any microSD card in this case. I like the that this is small  but holds a lot of memory and fits in the adapter, I have yet to find anything bad about these kind of memory.  I have to have this kind as some of electronic equip require use of a mini I bought this to use in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it works great.  Transfer speed is excellent and it is completely plug-and-play compatible with my device. I have two of these that I am using with a GoPro HERO3 and they work great (I will be getting more!).  While I could do the 64GB, I (so far) am preferring the 32GB, because the card is about full right when a battery reaches the end of it\\'s life so I can swap a card and battery at the same time and save opening/closing the case and swapping parts all of the time.  The card is plenty fast, never had any hiccups with that and they have proven to be quite reliable as I have a 3rd card that I have been using in multiple mobile phones (HTC and BB) since 2010 and have never had any problem at all with any of them. Using it in a 10&#34; Android Tablet and have had no issues. Mounted easily and seems to be doing it\\'s job! It works as expected. I use one of these on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and another on my Asus Transformer. No problems so far. It works as described. I bought 2. One for me and one for my wife\\'s tablet. I love Amazon and the ease of purchasing with super fast shipping. Item came in retail packaging that is hard to remove. They have to do this in stores to prevent theft. Just use scissors, you\\'ll get it out eventually. It shows 29.71 gigs when installed but this is typical for SD cards. Download the Sandisc memory Zone App to see how fast a card you need before you purchase one. It tells you exactly what you need and may save you a few bucks. It is hard to believe that 64gb is now the same size as your pinky finger nail.  No complaints, I use it in my LG phone and its plenty fast enough for anything I bought this for my mp3 player and it works great for moving music around. I like the fact it came with the adapter for card readers because cheaper ones don\\'t. I use this in a high def camcorder to record 1080p video.  I\\'ve had no problems with clipping.  The card seems well able to quickly handle the amount of data that gets pumped to it.  I\\'ve not had any quality control issues or data loss, either.  Would definitely buy again. for me i prefer sandisk over other manufacturers. i have  come to trust in the quality and workmanship of their products. Using the card in a Sandisk Sansa Clip+ and it works! 4000 songs and counting. What more is there to say? This was immediately recognized by my Windows 8.1 laptop. I had to re-format this from ExFAT to FAT32 in order to have it be recognized by my Samsung Note 2 and my 7&#34; Android tablet.It took a long time to transfer 25 gb of video files from laptop SSD hard drive over to the SdXC card--I imagined that it would happen more quickly. .. but it did work smoothly.Overall, this is what I wanted and it was a great deal for the price! Compact size is helpful and the transfer speed is quite good.  Highly recommend this for people who have large storage requirements. Came in genuine retail packaging, works great with my camera.  Works great with my computer.  I like the colors, it makes it easier to find in my dark camera bag where the tiny black ones get lost in the fabric. It\\'s fast. Works as described. Plenty of space left free now. Fast transfer speeds if used with compatible card reader. Would recommend.This product features Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging, which is recyclable. It comes without excess outer packaging materials such as hard plastic clamshell casings, plastic bindings, or wire ties. The packaging is designed to be opened without the use of a box cutter or knife, and it will protect your product just as well as traditional packaging.As of this writing, the Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card ia actually priced lower than other class-10 cards from PNY and Polaroid. This makes the Sandisk the best value - especially if you need honest class-10 performance across all platforms. SanDisk has always been a reliable brand for me, their products typically outlast the devices they were paired with.  This cards is decently fast, writing speed is able 10mb, and read is in the 24-6 range, it is plenty fast for HD video. I love this micro sd card. Awesome amount of space and just plain ole reliable. You dont find to many products like that nowadays. So far, so good.  It does what it\\'s supposed to do.  Doesn\\'t seem any faster or slower than any other micro SD card I had.  Bought a cheap imitation on Ebay and regretted it as it crashed.  It really doesn\\'t pay to be cheap with memory.  It\\'s all about the reliability, which you get with this product.10/17 Update:  Big problem with this SD card if you are a Windows Phone user - does not properly record HD video.  Video recording to SD card is consistently choppy.  Pop in another SD card - records fine.  Record to my phone - records fine.  I\\'ve tried formatting it every which way and it isn\\'t working well.  Go with another brand Windows Phone users. SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A fits very nicely in the HTC Vivid and the system recognized it right off the bat! Simple and easy to format the disk and then encrypting it was a snap as well. There are many reviews on the internet about this product possibly NOT working in the HTC Vivid....I am a believer in doing the research and reading the reviews. It works like a champ and the price was reasonable on Amazon! The price alone makes this product well worth it and being a class 10 and not having to pay a lot to get a quality disk is rare which is why I choose to order from amazon Plug and Play simplicity. Popped it in and it works. Didn\\'t even need to format it. I believe SanDisk said it was formatted as \\'exFat\\' so I\\'m good with that and so is my wife\\'s phone. It shows approximately 119Gb before use. Holds a whole heap of photos and videos. Got it for my samsung galaxy talet 2 10.1, its ideal for the tab.  No problems with it got it in the day I got it, does exactly what I want it to do Is, what it says it is! Great chip, fast, reliable. 6 months so far, not a single problem, and lots of handling too! Bought this for extended memory in a Galaxy S III.  Great price. Easy to install and the phone recognized it instantly. Does what its supposed to do. for the price this memory card works well and i have not had any issues with it in the surface It works, got on Black Fri deal or would have been cheap and gotten a 16-32GB. Nice to have endless room....I already have watched a movie while surfing net on phone (with pop out player). I have such a awesome phone now. It comes with a Standard SD Card adapter!!!!Funny story:I plugged it in and went to format and my phone wanted a password to format card. Dude I could not find anything about this and online some people asked the same question. Well, I realized what it was. If you have a lock screen on your phone, then it also puts that lock on formatting your card. What a Great idea Samsung thank you! What a duh moment for me. I use this in my smartphone (Samsung). Push in in and go. No problem. Good price. Enjoying a lot more music now. SanDisk chips are pretty good but relatively expensive at times.You\\'d think that online prices would be more affordable. It can be but you can Not tell if the seller is selling a fake product ot not.The one I received was genuine. Any of SanDisk products can be returned and exchanged for another if genuine so I\\'ve not had a problem in exchanges with the company **knocks on wood**!The 32gb version works well with Android tablets but not the 64gb versions so beware. I did read online at other forums that the 64gb version works relatively well, though, with Android phones, which is weird.Why would it work on the smartphone but not the tablet?Prices have dropped so it may have come down in prices at local retail stores so do shop around. There\\'s no way I can give this a bad rating because it does exactly what it\\'s supposed to do andthat\\'s espand the memory. I hve been using ScanDisk memory cards for a long time and I have never been disappointed. The apps for tablet are automatically downloaded to the memory card and I have had no issues or complaints. This micro sd card works great in my galaxy s4. It doubled my storage space and is quick to respond. would definitely recommend to anyone who buys a new smart phone. The card only read as 27 GB not 64 GB. I have formatted in various formats with various tools, and operating systems. I ordered a replacement and concluded this was a dud. Good luck buying this product, rest assured amazon has a good return policy. I noticed amazon had the \\'ultra\\' version for only a couple bucks more than the standard black version. And this one comes with an SD adapter in case I ever need it. I haven\\'t bothered to speed test it since I\\'m using it for the tablet and don\\'t feel like removing it from the tablet just for a test - but seems fast enough from my experience so far. Definitely faster than the regular black sandisk cards.From my experience with Sandisk products, their read/write speeds are much faster than they claim in their conservative estimates. It\\'s not worth messing with their standard line if you can get \\'ultra\\', \\'extreme\\', or \\'pro\\' for not much more. I put this in my Nokia Lumia 521 and so far it works really well. I put my entire iTunes library on my phone and it all wrote on the card I believe in under an hour (I didn\\'t keep track).My only regret is I probably should have purchased the 64GB card. This item was purchased for my smart phone and the sale price was excellent. The item arrived intact and on time and works great. I bought this as supplemental storage on my Asus Transformer TF201 tablet.  The card did not need any special formatting to work and just worked upon first installation. It stays plugged into my tablet non-stop and I\\'ve been using it for about 3 months for additional storage for music and videos without any problems.  I don\\'t have any speed benchmarks, but I haven\\'t noticed any slowness in copying or deleting large amounts of data on this device.  It does what it\\'s supposed to, so therefore, I give it 5 stars! This SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 micro SD card can storage an enormous among of data. And with the class 10 reliability and speed, it\\'s a great buy. I bought 2 of these for my 2 sons to save their games, songs and whatever else on their DSs. Had more space than they will use in quite awhile. It was priced superbly! There is no question about Sandisk, and their continued innovation with really keeping storage from any computer for those on the go. With any need for electronic files, or music or games securely stored and protected from computer to phones and MP3 Players and tablets, Micro SD Cards are becoming a increased need for laptops and computer needs. Sandisk has made several products through time, and they have continued to get better with innovation. Their Ultra Micro SDHC memory card handles very well. It works nicely with storing all my media files into one convient package. I like it because I can safely have all my MP3 files, in this card and play them with my Sandisk MP3 Player nicely. This is definitely a good buy for anyone that really wants a bit of extra space. I definitely recommend this Micro SD memory card for all the extra storage space.Price: BConvience: B+Overall: B 1/2+ First two order of this item were fails. They both failed around six months of use. However, Sandisk honored their warranty and completely replaced the items. Still using it, and pretty happy. I only buy SanDisk and this item like all the others I have purchased, worked perfectly the first time.  Love it! I use this in my GoPro Hero 3 Silver. Works great had no problems and the data transfer is very quick. stores a lot of HD pictures and videos. no longer do i have issues with SD card errors and losing my data. i highly recommend anyone buy class 10 SD cards for their devices. have had this for 5 months, no issues. Utilizing for my GOPRO Hero3 Black....no issues at all filming and transferring to my computer.  Good transfer rate and glad I got the 64GB for all the filming / photos done. Either it is the wrong chip or a false reading by the device because the data displayed consistently is &#34;insert ..&#34; This is the lowest priced 64 gb card I could find and it works great in my HERO go pro camera What can I say? It\\'s memory, the price was right and it\\'s fast. My galaxy note 10.1 doesn\\'t complain. Neither do I. Found these for a really good price.  Bought 2, one for my wife and myself for our Galaxy Note 2 phones.  Hers worked fine but I did have an issue right from the start.  However, luckily it was right from the start because I had almost nothing on it so I reformatted in the Galaxy Note 2 and it has worked fine ever since.  It is recommended not to format it on the computer so I formatted it with the phone.  It works good as for now. Seems to work fine in my Samsung . Galaxy III with the new android 4.1.1 os How big of a card can this phone handle&#62;  Anyone know? I am using it for my Hisense Sero Pro.  It has a fast xfer rate, up and down.  And measures out to ~29GB after format.  I am very happy with it! Back when I purchased my Samsung Galaxy S4, the deciding factor between it and the iPhone was the capability of SD card storage, so when the chance came to grab a 32GB card for 20 dollars, I jumped on it. It performs flawlessly, and comes with a standard sized SD card so you can fit the micro into it and access it from your computer.Folks, if you purchase an Android phone with SD card capabilities, don\\'t go for the 32GB phone and pay up to a hundred dollars more. Just grab a micro SD card for less, and thank me in the morning! I only buy SanDisk cards and this one is good just like I expected.  Great read and write speed and no issues whatsoever.  I also own the 64GB one and its just as good...Also comes with an adapter so you can use it in bigger/older size sd card slots.Buy with confidence! Unbelievable room in a tiny package.  So far have been able to store and retrieve hi-def video with no problems. Received today and there was a surprise in the package.  It contained an adapter so the Micro SD card can be used in a traditional SD slot.  I don\\'t need it, but I can see where it might come in handy if I want to transfer files directly to my laptop.Actually, I purchased this for a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 - 8&#34; tablet which also has a USB port for attaching a flash drive or any other storage, so I could always transfer data that way. In any case, I don\\'t expect any problems, but the Galaxy will not arrive until Monday. I use the extra space to put all my apps and podcasts on. I have yet to put music on it but I don\\'t think it will be a problem. I am using the 64 GB card in a Galaxy Note II phone and have had the card working perfectly from March to October. The speeds were fast and it always worked flawlessly.Then one day I decided to protect my data prior to going to Europe by encryping the card in the phone.The encryption process went properly and took about 3 hours (as my card was filled with about 18 gb of mostly image files).However, the phone then slowed down considerably and it took up to 10 second to decrypt the card every time I woke the phone up the screen. Needless to say I didn\\'t like that and decided to return the card back to decrypted state. I did the procedure of decrypting it back and when it was done, the card became urneadable. Attempting to format it in the phone as well as in the computer with various utilities programs did not help. The card showed those old folders being present despite multiple formats but I could neither access the files nor permanent write to the card. (The phone could save pictures to the card while it\\'s powered on but after restaring the phone, the newly taken pictures were gone).I contacted SanDisk who graciously exchange the card which now work great again. I give the card 4 stars just because I don\\'t know whether the experienced problem was due to the card or the phone. The SanDisk has shown itself to have great customer service and I really appreciate them exchanging the card. I will definitely not encrypt it anymore. When card works, it works super fast and reliably. MicroSDXC is the wave of future storage for any manufacturer that has any sense. These little cars can increase the storage capacity of the most basic of devices for far less than buying more expensive models that don\\'t allow external storage. Easy to use and with an industry standard that expands up to 2TB in capacity. one of the best memory cards for a good low price. SanDisk Has and Will Always be a great company to do business with. SanDisk quality shines through every time.I tried cheaper memory cards and have watched them fail over time.Even my oldest SanDisk flash stuff still all work years after purchasing and that\\'s enough reason to pay more. I put this in my GS3 and it works fine. Tons of storage and stuff still loads very quickly and transfers well. I bought this after I found out that you can add a memory card to the Samsung galaxy s4! I never even knew that you could, and so once I found out I bought this and installed it. It\\'s worked perfectly since and holds all of my songs and videos.  Great buy! I haven\\'t had any problems with this card.  I use it with my Galaxy S3.  The transfer speeds have been quite fast and I didn\\'t have to format the card.  Between this card and my Dropbox, I don\\'t ever foresee me running out of space. I got this for my phone and it is working well as storage for my music and images.  I would order this again if I needed another. Do your self a favor and get some memory for that fancy new phone.I have taken countless photos & videos, downloaded several apps andloaded a bunch of music and still have room to spare. I purchased this for my Wandboard Quad.  I loaded the Wandboard provided Android 4.2.2 image and have had zero issues.  As the OS boots and runs from this card, it boots pretty quickly (though not as quickly as if it were booting from eMMC), and runs smoothly once at the Android launcher. Works well. Use in my Galaxy s4 as an expansion card. Works well. Have used and liked SanDisk cards before. I can\\'t read or write anything on this card on my PC or my GS3. I am pretty sure that I got a dud. Works great. Only problem is that if i put the card in a multi car reader it does not read the car. Has to be put in a SD CARD ONLY reader to work and be read by computer I think a really good memory card at good price. I got it and still have s lot of space for all my music and videos. I use one in my go pro\\'s, Note 3 and S5 and they all work great. I would recommend no doubt :D Using it on my Surface Pro to add extra storage and is working fine. It\\'s as fast as I would want it to be and was plug and play like a memory card should be.Came as exFAT which with Windows 8 isn\\'t a problem, but if you are using an OS that is over a decade old (looking at you, XP) you may have issues.BitLocker to go works fine with the card as you would expect. I got this to use with the HP Slate 7- EXTREME (even though that device is supposed to only use 32 GB), I formatted it FAT32 and \\'mounted\\' it, and it works great... The docs for my Smart Phone said that this card would work in it.  After talking to SanDisk support I was told that a 32GB card was the max for my phone.  So I returned this card for a 32GB.  This card is probably a very good product.  Just the documentation for my phone was bad. Works like a charm in my Galaxy Note 3.  I\\'m tired of getting bogus SD cards off another major auction house. I just purchased a new laptop that has both a micro and regular SD card slotyou can\\'t beat the price!product is as described and arrived very quickly Purchased this for my Galaxy S3. Went from a 32 GiB internal to a total of 64 GiB of storage. The card hasn\\'t presented any problems and seems pretty speedy. I use it for storing all my nandroid backups and ROM downloads. I bought this to expand storage in my Samsung Galaxy Reverb.  I was getting 8-10 MB/s transfer speed while transferring MP3s on my commodity SD card reader (Kodak brand, $10-$15 at any supermarket electronics section).  It is worth noting that UHS-1 cards basically revert to class 10 if your hardware isn\\'t UHS-1 compatible.I\\'ve been using the card for a month or so and have never had trouble with it - no read errors, no mount errors, no bad sectors.I got mine on a Black Friday sale, so the value was great.  Do some price shopping - if the price is good, you can\\'t go wrong with this if you want a big micro SD card.  As usual, Sandisk is a good way to go. As I expect from sandisk, this card is fast, reliable and works great with the gopro 3.Comes with the adapter.....pretty cool to have 64gig of space on such a small ad card.Not cheap, but worth the money, in my opinion. Bought this because I discovered that I had accidently left a class 2 card in my phone for over a year. Was troubleshooting the sluggishness and realized my error. This card, while not officially supported, works perfectly fine. I partitioned it using the ROM Manager. Also installed Link2SD and moved the largest apps to an ext2 partition. Hopefully these will get cheaper but worth every cent to have more recording time I used 5 of these for Christmas work great and you have good eyes !!! in my Samsung note 2. fast no delays. transfers data in fon and to pc immediately. Good value for a top rated card. Installed in Samsung Galaxy S3.Latest Verizon stock rom supports exFAT, and you can format this your Windows PC.You can also format this NTFS and use several 3rd party apps to mount automatically. (suggest Paragon). I\\'ve been using this card in my smartphone for a while now. It had enough room for all of my 20gig of music. Its got tons of pictures and downloads too. Still plenty of room. If you like to store data on your phone this will be good for you. no hiccups so far with this product. This will be a very unscientific review as I did not conduct any benchmarks.Purchased this card for my Galaxy Note 2 since T-Mobile only offered the 16GB version of the phone.Review:I researched this purchase prior to buying it on Amazon so I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this card and have to jump through hoops to get it recognized by my Galaxy Note 2.When the card arrived I immediately put it into my phone.  The card was instantly recognized and the phone booted up and mounted the SD Card without any prompting.Boot seemed very fast, faster than the stock card that came with my phone.  Again, unscientifically, this card seems much much faster than my old card.  All my movies and photos seem to come up quickly without much delay.My usable space reported is 59.45GB.I highly recommend this card to anyone.  It is extremely fast and very easy to use (for my Galaxy Note 2 phone at least).Pros:-Phone boots faster-A lot of space to store movies, music and pictures-Worked the first time I plugged it in without any special hoops to jump throughCons:-None Use this in my Windows 8 tablet. Works well and I can get close to the published throughput of 30MB/s. Works great with the HD 720P Dual Lens IR Night Vision Car DVR Camera Dash Cam Video Recorder Motion Detection. Huge capacity and recognized without a hitch on galaxy s3. Reasonably fast card with huge amounts of storage for a good price. I bought this item and at first the card was defective however a quick online chat with sandisk and two weeks later I had a new working device. Not much to say other than a Great product and company. Definitely recommend. Delivery was on time and the device worked perfectly for my Microsoft Surface Pro. I needed extra memory for my Surface and this 64G was perfect. It fits in my phone. It holds lots of stuff. It comes with a reader that works in my laptop. Great brand and excellent price. I purchased this for my Lenovo IdeaTab A2109 tablet. The adapter comes in handy when I need to use for a standard SD slot. Works great in my Galaxy SIII, allows me to both take considerable more music and video with me, while also recording more pictures and video.I haven\\'t done speed benchmarks on the card, but when copying mp3\\'s to it at no point did I think &#34;this is a slow piece of crap.&#34;, as I have with other SD cards previously.  The included adapter made it work directly in my laptop as well.I do recommend anyone with a memory card this large does regular backups to their PC or other media - as nice as it is to be able to take 64gb of pictures, it would make it even worse if you lost your phone and they were the only copy. I bought this for the expandable memory in my Galaxy Note 2, and it works perfectly without any issues. It is plug and play, no format required, at least with Jellybean. Very fast card, works great in my GS4. I wanted something very fast but reliable and this is the ticket. I will start by saying I do not really understand the whole &#34;class&#34; rating system of these cards. This is described as class 10, which to my minor research, is pretty fast at uploading and downloading data. And it seems to me to work just fine. Didn\\'t take very long to upload some HD movies I had on my computer that I wanted on my phone. My thought with buying this was simply this.... Why short change myself? Ill just buy the biggest(capacity) and the alleged \\'fastest\\' and by happy. And I am. Awesome, just awesome. Great speed also. I use this in a Nikon DSLR, taking 24MP pictures, and this thing rips though them like nothing. I haven\\'t had any heat issues at all or data loss. I have tested this card in both a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone and aSamsung Galaxy Tab 3 (10.1-Inchand it was immediately recognized by both devices. As I write this review the card has been running in my Tab 3 and constantly used for over a week.Other reviews have dissected the specs of this card, so I\\'ll share how I use it and why I prefer these over the 64GB cards (which I also own and use). The price point on these 32GB cards have dramatically fallen and as of the date of this review they are priced as commodities. I use a few pairs of these to rotate backups on my laptop, so I always have a daily snapshot of my documents. For that purpose alone these cards are well worth it.For my tablet I have divided my extensive music library into genres and have them backed up to these cards. A 32GB card will hold about 150 CDs, so the space savings along over the physical media is significant. In fact one of these cards cost about the same as a rack for 150 CDs.These are also excellent for saving practice sessions that I sometimes record using my phone or tablet. I pop my primary SD card out of the device and swap one of these in to video record. Since this card will hold about six hours of video it\\'s perfect for that use.Overall, these are reliable cards that have worked in a number of devices I own. I can assure anyone wanting to use them in a newer Samsung Note 2 or 3 phone or Tab 3 tablet that this card will work, and it is also excellent for HD video recording. At the price point it\\'s an absolute bargain. Best price I could find for a high quality Micro-SD for my Samsung S4 cell phone. Every store in the area charged crazy prices for lesser quality cards. Don\\'t even think of buying any sort of card from your cell phone service provider. They are the worst ! Amazon all the way for cell phone accessories. Items like cases, screen protectors , Micro-SD memory cards. Purchased this for my Galaxy S3 phone. The phone has 16 GB internal memory and you can\\'t use this with it. Luckily it came with an adapter and I use it in my card reader for storage. I go from the PC to the phone. Its worth the money but remember its useless with the Galaxy S3 Got this SD card for my Blackberry Z10, now I have 80gb of total storage! Try doing that iPhone5 lovers! Sandisk has made great memory products for a very long time. This is no exception. I bought this to expand the memory of a tablet I bought for my fianc&eacute;e, and it works well. I made sure to buy Class 10 because i want the fastest interaction between the device and the storage. Nothing ruins a user experience like waiting for storage to access and being read from, or written to. Works superbly with my Microsoft Surface RT. One of the best micro sdhc card you can get on the market for the price This works much better than any sd card I had in the past (I have class 4 off brand cards) and it is perfect for the tablet that I bought it for. It does the job, found it cheaper after I bought it. Bummer is the first thing that came to mind. I have bought several of these and find they do just what they are designed to hence 5 stars. I recommend this memory card for any electronic device that requires a micro SDHC card and from past experience find that SanDisk is a reputable name brand. A scan disc is a standard thing however the price for this 32GB was a good deal and the shipping was quick. This was a good buy would definitely recommend ! Not sure what you can say about a storage disk. It arrived on time, works as advertised. I had no trouble installing it in my new Yoga 10 tablet. My Droid Razr runs a little slow, is it because of this card?  I can\\'t be sure.  What I am sure about is I put this card into my GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition and the video I record comes out choppy.  So I bought the SanDisk Extreme Pro 16GB version of this card, and the GoPro works fine now.  SanDisk is normally very good, so perhaps I somehow got a bad Ultra card.  I never returned or exchanged it because the warranty had expired before I tried it in my GoPro and knew for sure the card was slow.  The SanDisk Ultra should work in the GoPro Hero 3 according to the GoPro website, so again, perhaps I just got a subpar card... good Great micro sd card! very helpful to store my media files and has no problem for my Samsung Galaxy note2!! Purchased this for my wife\\'s new Samsung Galaxy 5S since she takes so many photos and always runs out of space before downloading to her computer. Okay, who am I kidding, she NEVER downloads them to her computer. I have to do it because, well, I\\'m a dude and dudes do that sort of thing. Most women (notice I said *most* women) let the guys handle the tech stuff and my wife is certainly no exception. I\\'m not saying women aren\\'t or cannot be tech savvy, but mine isn\\'t. Ask her a question about hair care products and she\\'ll talk you into a daze, expounding on the virtues of quality, expensive conditioners but she prefers to leave \"that techy junk\" to me. And God forbid if I accidentally write \"your\" instead of \"you\\'re\" in an email but that\\'s for another conversation, preferably over Captain Morgan Special Reserve. However - if I ever need advice on what shampoo to use instead of Pert shampoo and condition-in-one, she will be my go to resource!PROS:It\\'s little, bitty memory card, careful, it\\'s easy to lose.CONS:It\\'s little, bitty memory card, careful, it\\'s easy to lose. Great price, shipped fast, and well packaged. I have an incredible amount of space in my Raspberry Pi now! Class 10 is the way to go... very usefull to use in the phone also they come with the adpator to SD i will remomend it :) I purchased this card for use in a Microsoft Surface Pro tablet -- for that, it works great. 64GB is a nice capacity, card was cheap and it works just fine.The problem, however, was in transfer speed. It\\'s rated at &#34;up to&#34; 30MB/sec which I guess is true.. but mine has never reached anywhere close to that. Using 3 different readers (the Surface Pro itself, a higher-end desktop PC with built-in MicroSD reader and an external USB 3.0 MicroSD reader.. in all, it maxed out around 10-12MB/sec (and on multiple smaller files it maxed out closer to about 5MB/sec total). I know it\\'s not the card readers as I have been able to reach speeds of 90MB/sec with other/faster cards.The card itself DOES work fine. For that I give it 5 stars. The price is great for the size, for that I give it 5 stars. The transfer speeds are just disappointing though.. taking 5 minutes to transfer an iTunes movie file is a long time.. it\\'ll take hours to fill the full card.. If you only load data once, it\\'s not so bad, but if you\\'re always adding/deleting/moving data, it\\'s slow and will get annoying quickly! It worked well that one time I put some files on it. It was easily read by my computer and phone. Then I lost it because it was so tiny. Oh well! great sandisk micro SD card. havent had anyproblems with this one. its fast and it loads good. i approve this I bought this for my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, for some reason I couldnt get it to work in it.  So I put it in my Galaxy Note 2 phone and it works great.  I have 7 movies and other assorted crap on it and it still has plenty of room. A+ on product and seller- Came as described- shipping was very fast- I was excited to see how this class 10 was compared to other micro sd cards. I have it in my new galaxy s4- Pulls pictures videos quickly and stores them just as good. I have already recommended this to friends. Bought this for my Microsoft Surface Pro for extra storage and it works great I just put it in the slot and it showed up in my computer just like it was supposed to. Not much to say here other than it works fine.  I use it in the SD RAM slot in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. No performance issues and will provide more than enough extra storage for a tablet. I bought this for my Microsoft Surface rt and it works great with it. I would recommend it to anyone. This is a great card and the write speeds are fast enough for your more intensive workloads, like video. I purchased this card for use in a Samsung Galaxy Note II and III and have had no problems with it. I bought this to create a larger store for my RPi Model B and it works flawlessly so far. Fast and plenty of space. A good deal for the price I paid. I have gotten up to 15(expecting 30 is unrealistic I suppose) and consistently gotten 11 to 13 MB/s with this which is fast enough so that it only takes a few minutes to transfer 20GB at a time. Good little SD card for a good price. I have and will continue to reccomend this microSD. Using in my EVO LTE phone. Haven\\'t got much to say about this. It\\'s SanDisk, so you know what you\\'re getting. Fast and reliable. Only complaint though is that Amazon wouldn\\'t let me buy more than one in the same order. Other than that, it\\'s just great. Nothing wrong with it so far. Definitely enjoying it, going to turn it into a bootable card for emergency recoveries, as well as store my device backups on it. It will be my magic-computer-fixing key. Very good product!!!  Comes with an adaptor to fit regular size card slot.So your good to go for both.( I love it) Great price for the size card your getting. Bought this for my S3. Can easily fit all my movies now. This is a great card and holds all of my fun items :-).  I have a mass of ebooks that don\\'t take up much room, and I also get to store my favorite movies on it as well. Use this in my GoPro 3 silver edition.  Even at 1080p/30 I get about 9 hours of video.  Write time is great and I have had no problems writing video to this card real-time.  I have been happy with all of my SanDisk purchases. One the better names in making computer accessories,  this works just fine in my LG Optimus G Pro, now I have 64GB.  I will purchase again Many devices cannot use this size of card, but works perfectly in my Samsung GS4. Plenty of additional space for whatever I need. No problems to date. Excellent! Is just what it says it is.  Works great and holds a ton of photos in our camera.  Haven\\'t had any issues with it, but I\\'m not a techy so can\\'t really compare it to other brands. I got this SD Card for my phone. Works well. No issues. It was cheap and exactly what I needed. It was exactly the memory card I ordered. I tested it using the adapter that came with it by plugging it into my computer. Worked great.I replaced the 8 GB card already in my new tablet (a month old) with the new 32GB card and everything ground to a halt. Waiting a long time made no difference.The maximum card size for my tablet is 32GB. I guess for now it\\'s just an ornament. That\\'s why it was the unexpected. That\\'s why it only got 4 stars.Update: the memory card may not be at fault. I bought this for my Samsung S4 Acitve. It fit perfectly and I have had no problems with it. The price was really reasonable for the size of GB you get. Not really much to comment on as I have had good experiences with SanDisk Ultra in the past. They are a little more pricey than some of the other brands but only by a couple bucks. What you get is &#34;no surprises&#34;. They pop into your phone, camera, tablet and basically work forever. I don\\'t run speed tests so can\\'t comment on whether they are plus / minus milliseconds faster than another brand (a millisecond here or there really is not a big deal to me). I\\'ve never had a failure with a SanDisk product (or Kingston, another good value).I used it for awhile in my Asus Tablet but currently it has been moved over to my Droid. Works as advertised a was an excellent value. Bought these for use in my kids\\' tablets, have not had any problems with them in several months of use, price was very good and transferring speeds are more than adequate. I bought this for a Sansa Clip+, it worked after formatting the card to FAT32.  Can\\'t say much other than I have tons of lossless songs here that were previously on CDs.  What I don\\'t like in general is that manufacturers LIE about real size of cards arguing some technical issue, it\\'s like saying that 2+2=5, when in reality is not, this card like any other card is not 64gb, it\\'s more like 62gb (can\\'t remember exact size, don\\'t have card available at hand).2+2 is not =5.  This card is advertised as 64gb yet in reality is lower, manufactures using false advertising as usual. This kinds of memory cards are a good example of false advertisement. My first computer had 64k of RAM.I just put this in my GoPro Hero camera. It has 1,000,000 time more memory. It is great and it works great too.I just initialized it in the the GoPro and I\\'m saving pictures.Fantastic Inserted the memory card in my Galaxy S4 phone and it immediately recognized it. Can you ask for anything more?! Used the h2testw software to check the read/write speed and got write 9.8MB/s and read 16.6MB/s.  I have no complains.or, should I have no complains?Warning: Only 1000 of 15185 MByte tested.Test finished without errors.You can now delete the test files *.h2w or verify them again.Writing speed: 8.98 MByte/sReading speed: 16.4 MByte/sH2testw v1.4compared to the 4x cardWarning: Only 1000 of 14737 MByte tested.Test finished without errors.You can now delete the test files *.h2w or verify them again.Writing speed: 4.39 MByte/sReading speed: 16.4 MByte/sH2testw v1.4 I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy 10.1. It works great! I have had no problems with it!I would definitely buy this again. Seller was also very fast in shipping! its perfect and easy to use and conect fast to the camera its give you 9940 photo and 45m video with sony cam 18mp What\\'s more to say, this is the biggest MicroSDXC card at the time with the reliability of Sandisk with great speed.  I have one in all of my tablets and both mobile phones.  I have yet to have an issue with this card and don\\'t expect to. Great product for the sale price, hard to beat 37$ for 64GB. Worked well on the PC, then on a Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet. Speed is nothing to write home about, but close to what manufacturer suggested (30/10) The card works in the above mentioned phones but I did have to format it using another program downloaded for Windows. Windows will not let you format the card for FAT32 which is the format you need to use for the phones to see the card. The also could not format the cards correctly on their own, but once I was able to format them properly, they worked perfectly. I bought 2 of these.  They arrive before the due date and were in perfect shape. I installed one in an old smart phone and it is working again.  Good service. the card arrived promptly in good condition. i don\\'t use exfat so i reformatted it to ntfs but fyi some for example cameras only recognize fat32 so keep that in mind. i have used this for a few months now and have had absolutely no issues. a great value imho. this microsdhc card fit perfect in my grandsons tablet. its great to be able to download extra music and games for him. I got this on sale for $42.99, which is really low for what it is. As soon as it arrived I transferred all the data from the 8GB Micro SD that was in my Samsung Galaxy S III to this SD card, at first my phone didn\\'t see the card, I rebooted my phone and now everything is in perfect working order. I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do with all this space, but I\\'m sure I\\'ll figure something out. Brand speaks for itselfRecommend to a size 64 GBPrice is a bit highSanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card I ordered this memory card because, obviously i needed more space on my phone. One of the reasons why I prefer android to apple products is it is way easier to upgrade storage space with android. My memory card arrived when I expected it to and now I have more than enough space on my galaxy S4....... I once gave this product a five star and everything before this sentence is the review from when I was satisfied with it. But now I\\'m having problems. I can\\'t delete stuff of of the sd card. I tried formatting it on both my phone and my computer but nothing well delete so now I\\'m giving it a two star. Excellent product, comes with an full size SD card adapter. I consistently got 10MBps writes and 32 MBps reads. (note its MBps not Mbps). Highly recommended. Phone\\'s internal memory was nearly always full, so it was obvious I needed some more memory. SanDisk is reliable. The card performs to spec, and is fast! well what can you say for the card it has plenty of memory and cam wouldn\\'t work with out it so it\\'s a must have Thanks This is one of those products that either works or it doesn\\'t (which rarely happens), so what can I say.  It work\\'s great.  32 GB allows plenty of room for storage in my tablet, and with the high rate transfer speed apps run as quickly as if they were using internal memory storage. With the small 16 G onboard memory in this Tablet, the added 32 makes it pleasurable for textbooks, music and pictures. Like all SanDisk products I have purchases in the past, this little card works just fine in my phone and I have not had any issues at all. What else does one need, right?And it does come with the adapter in case you want to use it on the SD slot. or put it into a flash drive adapter to use on your usd PC port.Great price here!!! If you\\'re using this on a device that records video and photos, this is highly recommended. The class 10 classification means this thing will keep up with what you\\'re recording without skipping a beat. This is perfect for devices such as the GoPro cameras. Nice product very helpfully . We believe in this products san disk if we need more we do not hesitate to buy another one. Card works great. It shipped very quickly. It doesn\\'t hold 64GB of data, more like 59GB but either way it gives me all the space I need on my phone for music and pictures. awesome little sd card, my phone is 32GB but I still wanted more for music and videos and this totally works great, as soon as I put it on my phone read it and also it is fast.. I am happy with my purchase.. The best there is under this category. make sure you research before you buy this card for your phones. Lots of Android phones still dont make use of the UHS-1 technology for transfer rate. You will still get good transfer rate but not the best. Works as describe.  If your going to use it in a phone I would suggest putting it into phone and letting your phone format it, this will save you a bunch of headaches later. Great card. Now they need to make a more 128 gb cards so I can buy one of those without having to pay double. 200 bucks..?  No thanks. It fits perfectly in the Surface RT, unfortunately the advertisement for the RT didn\\'t say which memory device was supposed to go in it and a regular size card was originally bought and opened before we could figure that part out.  Nothing wrong with this product and it makes my 64GB Surface large enough to hold a whole term of school information. I have purchased several Sandisk sd cards for its reliability and function. This is just one of the purchases and I will be ordering more. It works for my tablet, camera and computer. Love it ! Samsung Galaxy Note can\\'t read this card, have to be format in Fat32. Just Google the small program to do the trick. Work perfect. Works amazingly in my Nokia Lumia 2520. Highly suggest this item and distributor to everyone, fast service. For the price these cards provide a good compromise in terms of speed and cost.  I use them with IOGear USB 3.0 adapters and they work well in that capacity. Works great, no issues so far. Speed is fairly good, alot better then my 2gb I had in an old camera. Use in my Go Pro Hero 3+ works just as would be expected for a memory card. Price was good. Bought this for my wife to use in her phone and it is fast and error free. Some cards do not show up with the correct size but this one does. Bought for my Note 3.  Works as advertised. 64gb and class 10 speeds offer great capacity and read/write speeds for HD viewing and recording. I really like these SanDisk Ultra microSDHC Class 10 cards.  I have several and when I see huge price drops I pick them up for phones, cameras, GPS\\' as well as tablets, on which I store video files for traveling.  I\\'ve never had a problem with a SanDisk. Has worked flawlessly with my GoPro Hero 3 Black since I placed it in the camera. Purchased 2 top have on hand. Others have their Hero 3 cameras  &#34;Freeze&#34;, &#34;Shut Down&#34;, or write files that are not usable. I recommend this card to anyone needing a class 10 card that can handle the workload.half second timelapse, 2.7k HD video, 720p-120p video, not a problem for this card. Samsung 32Gb I bought on EBay failed. This works great. Never buy from China Gadgets on EBay. The cards are phony and burn up. I believe that this was a good price for this card its being used in a go pro without any issues. I have not had any problems with this product and it works as it is supposed to so I would buy again. Worked perfectly in Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 with no additional formatting. Seems as fast as the internal memory of the tablet so no need to pay for more than 16 gig in the tablet if you buy one. Adds 64 gig of storage for less than upping the tablet to 32 gig. Fast shipping as always with Prime. Ordered two of these and none works w my Cell Phone, Audio player or Camera.Guys, you have a problem...................................................................................... Bought this and have tested in my Canon SX260. Videos record quick and replay without any loss.Placed in my Samsung Galaxy Tab and works great!Nothing bad to report about this SDHC module. I bought this for media storage on my Surface 2 and absolutely love it. It allows me to store my videos, pictures, and music on a removable drive and keep my tablets memory free for apps. I would recommend this to anyone with a tablet looking to expand their storage capabilities. Shipping and packaging were perfect and quick. Bought this with my Samsung Galaxy S4 when it first came onto market and it worked for about a week then quit. All of the pictures I had taken originally and stored on this card are just gone, it was a bad purchase and after looking through numerous forums, hundreds or thousands of people were having the same issues with this card and the Galaxy S3 + 4, I do not recommend buying this card if you\\'ll be putting it in a galaxy. I\\'d like to tell sandisk where they can put it. I installed these on my Samsung Note 3 and S4 and have not had a single issue. Plenty of space for music, photos, videos, and apps. Unable to read.It says it\\'s blank.It then prompts to format or cancel.I clicked Format but Unable to Format. no problems works well does what it is supposed to do, store files.  Pretty quick read and write speed as well It stores stuff like any other memory card.  Amazon - fantastic price.  I bought this for my Samsun Galaxy tablet 3 8.0 and it works perfect.  This maxes out the memory for that tablet.  Tip: store all your apps etc on your tablets internal memory and photos, movies, pictures on this card.  If you ever run out of space you can keep and extra card or two on hand.  If you store apps on this card then you will not be about to use them if you want to change out the card. I bought this card specifically to run CyanogenMod 10 to my old nook Nook Color to breathe some life back into the device that I never use anymore. This card works great to run CM10 with the Nook thanks to its speed. A quick overclock of the processor via CM10 and the tablet is dare I say &#34;peppy&#34;. I highly recommend this card for any application where speed is crucial. Currently using this in a Samsung galaxy S4,with zero issues just put it in your phone and you are good to go.  Apps also seem to run faster off this card than internal memory.  Taking photos/videos at full hd definitely goes quicker than my old 32gb SanDisk card.  Definitely recommend this product. I tried this both on Android tablets and the MS Surface.Pros:-True Class 10 read and write speeds-Works with Android phones/tablet and the new Surface tabletCons:-None so far. What else can i say holds a lot of my stuff! Fits perfectly in my phone add no weight. Buy it! Great MicroSD, fast and holds a ton of memory.  If you really need one buy it and you won\\'t be disappointed. if you need a good sd card this works perfect for you smart phones, has all the memory you will need, very fast transfer rate Above average speed and perfect for the photographer needing ample file space. Can easily be used as a micro or SD card in different format cameras.  Fair pricing.Cons:  NONE So far so good, this card works fine in my LG Optimus L9. Its been about 5 days, and I\\'ve added 20gb\\'s of music on it. I will update if this card fails me in the future. Samsung is my preferred memory brand but SanDisk runs a close 2nd. 64 GB should be great when I upgrade my Motorola RAZR to a new Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with it\\'s 16 MP camera. The only reason I give one star is that I cant give zero stars.Just lost all my files in the SD in my S3. I cant believe I trust my valuable information in this company. AVOID THIS ITEM. Dont recommend it. Using it with my HTC One Max, and had no problems using it at all.  Write speed is excellent when taking picture, and no delay is encountered at all. The SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter handles its job as you would expect from SanDisk. There\\'s not much to say about this product, other than it works perfectly as it should.  I originally bought this for a tablet that had an expansion slot, but I returned that for another tablet without one.  So I thought I didn\\'t have a use for this card anymore, but I was wrong.  It turns out that when you put it in it\\'s full size SD card adapter, it even works perfectly in my Nikon D90 DSLR.  Up until now I had been using a standard 8gb card, which was fine, but 64gb is even better!  I don\\'t do burst shooting, so I can\\'t attest to how quickly it can write, but I noticed no difference in speed between this and the standard card that I had been using. Amazing how 64GB now fits on a micro card.  I added this to the ASUS Vivo Tablet to extend the memory and am very glad that I purchased it.  Working great and have always trusted ScanDisk!Great item......Great purchase! no problem with setup on this.  Instructions were clear.  Quality of chip is high and I expect to get many years of service life from it.  When I\\'m finished with it I think I can use it with that jar of onion/sour cream dip I bought in 1985 I researched online and found that this is a true Class 10 micro SD card. Manufacturers can use different calculations to be able to list a &#34;Class 10&#34; rating that is, in truth, a lie. This is the real deal. I\\'m glad these are red and grey and not all black to be honest.  After dropping a black one in the grass the other night.  Spent 20 minutes searching a 9 sq foot area!  Seriously they need to not ever make removable storage smaller than these things.Other than that..it works great, no problems whatsoever.  If you need to reformat, it\\'s suggested you use the sd formatting tool from the SD Association, of which SanDisk is a permanent member.  Windows doesn\\'t exactly follow the specification, though for most uses windows format will work too.Here\\'s the funny part.  This is about $2 more than the 32GB SanDisk class 4 card.  I\\'ve been waiting for those cards to drop in price as faster speeds take over...but they don\\'t drop in price.  And thanks to the newegg free shipping on items over $25, it\\'s actually cheaper overall when you order the $25 class 10 card and get free shipping instead of the $23 class 4 card plus $8.75 shipping. I installed the memory in my new Galaxu S4 and it gave me plenty space. No worries anymore about lack of space to take pictures or video This turned my Samsung Galaxy S3 into a Tardis.  It\\'s bigger on the inside!I haven\\'t done anything speccy to figure out the read/write speeds, etc., but I know that HD content both records and plays without a hiccup, and really that\\'s all that matters to me. There was no need to format or set it for fat32. The micro SDXC worked out of the box. I couldn\\'t be more satisfied. Make sure to format to FAT32 to be compatible with both AOSP and Touchwiz roms. If you\\'re not running any AOSP roms, just pop the card in. It will be formatted to exFAT automatically. I formatted to FAT32 with guiformat in PC and haven\\'t had any issues. *Optional* Search the xda-developer forum for instructions on swapping internal SD card with external SD card and give your phone 64GB of \"internal\" space for those apps that won\\'t move to SD. SanDisk is well known for their microsd cards. I placed one of these 64GB cards in my Galaxy Note II and love all the extra storage on my phone for video, music, work docs, etc. Haven\\'t had any issues with the card thus far and it has been working great in my Note II. Bought 3 of these cards to use for using in my digital camera. They all worked great and was able to pop right in to either my phone of my tablet as they only take microSD cards. Use for regular pictures and HD video without any problems. Speed does not seem to be any problem as people who bought other cards from other manufacturers. SanDisk is the only card that I recommend using. I\\'ve had two of these cards so far. Neither of them were recognized by Mac or PC. I am able to use it but only if I leave it in the Gopro camera and hook up the Gopro to the Mac via USB. It will not work as a normal SD card and needs to be used with the camera. I can not recomend this card at all. I had the first card replaced because it was defective. Now the second card is defective also. I don\\'t have the time to play around with another return so I will just not ever buy Sandisk again. No issues so far, stores a lot of video.  Not too expensive and no issues with quality or speed.  Works fine with my gopro camera.  Highly recommend. very happy, good product and quality, works fine does the job. i use it with my android it is fast and reliable Bought this for my new smartphone.  Installed easily and works as required.  In many years I have had no problems with any San Disk product that I have used. Got this for use with the Dell Venue 32GB.  With a smaller hard drive space, it was critical for all downloads, videos, photos, etc to be on the microSD.  Speed is more than adequate.  Great deal for $20 Great card for note 2 and galaxy 3...you can\\'t do this on iPhone..lolYou need more storage get this...but I don\\'t really like scandisk..don\\'t trust them..I read they have a lot problems with there cards. My review is a little backwards&#8230; but I thought the most relevant should go first.WARNING: ONLY BUY THIS CARD ON SALE!The *typical* price since summer 2013 is about $24 for 32 GB, and about $48 for 64 GB.  DO NOT pay any more than this, and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time / patience.The lowest (non-lightning) price hit about $18.00 for 32GB and $35 for 64GB, in early December.  I basically buy when the price hits $20 or less, and the 64 nears $40.00.From December 2013 to January 2014, I watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis.  They initially went on sale for about $17.95 and $34.95 for 32 and 64 respectively.  I watched them slowly increase in price, with random dips and peaks for a month.  On January 6th 2014, they still show as a &#34;Best Deal on Amazon&#34; for &#34;7 more days&#34; but they are at the highest price point since last summer -- and higher than I have *ever* payed for these cards!  So don\\'t let the &#34;Best Deals&#34; section deceive you, at $27/$50, these are NOT a &#34;deal&#34; in terms of price.Okay, here\\'s my actual &#34;review&#34; of these absolutely great SDXC cards.****I have tried a variety of MicroSDXC cards, and so far the Samsung Ultra UHS1 are the best -- and the price can\\'t be beat -- for all the most important reasons: speed, capacity, reliability, durability.I have not had a single failure, and I use these cards in my Nook HD+, Nexus 7 2013 (via USB) and my Canon 5D Mark II (with converter) and MacBook Pro (In the card slot).  They\\'re durable and waterproof, and  I can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting.  I even had one go through the wash, and I still use it for pictures.For the technically inclined, I have cards with *both* the Clockwork Mod bootloader (for the Nook HD+) and the MagicLantern firmware for my Canon EOS 5D II on the same card.  I can pull it from the Nook, shoot pictures with the camera, and look at the results on the Nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other.  This should be possible with any SDXC/SDHC card, but it turns out that the Samsung UHS1 is the only card I\\'ve found that works reliably.  Some cards won\\'t boot because they\\'re too slow too finicky, but all my Samsung UHS1s work great (the 64GB will not boot in the Nook, but no 64GB card will).I keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they\\'ve performed so well for me.  Samsung also has a newer, faster card, but its price-point hovers somewhere north of &#34;prohibitive&#34; so I still stick with these.  And that\\'s good news regardless because as the new card increases its market share, these should drop even further in price. Maybe I got a defective card but this one felt a bit &#34;thinner&#34; and &#34;flimsier&#34; than other micro-SD cards I\\'ve had.The real problem was after a week of use as expanded storage in a tablet, I started having trouble with certain programs installed on the card, then finally the tablet gave me a message that the card was corrupt, and while a PC would recognize it, eery time I tried to format the card, there would be an error. Recieved this fast, copied over all my stuff which took very little time and now I have plenty of space and speed. Received a defective one that did not want to format.  Returned it.  Bought a different brand instead although from past experience Sandisk has been fine. Tested it by storing some apps and taking a few pics and videos.I am not techie enuf to run any specific tests. Great price and it\\'s fast. Works well in my Note 3 using USB 3.0. I have movies shows and tons of music. I\\'m never bored anywhere I go. The best MicroSD card around for shooting with goPro black edition.Had enough memory to record all my dives and then some. in 1080 wide settings.Will get more of this lil Giant After buying a generic card and having a terrible experience, I purchased the SanDisk Ultra.  My only regret was not buying this product first.  SanDisk is a brand worth buying. Memory Card works fine, no problems.  I have a number of SanDisk Memory Cards, and I\\'ve never had any problems with them. I really dont have much to say about SanDisk\\'s cards. They work as intended, I never had a problem with them. This is the best micro memory for an android phone! It\\'s very fast running as fast as 38mb/s. The 30gb was a splurge but if you have movies or videos on your phone than this is perfect! Amazing product!P. S. Do not get the ultra mobile version of this, it\\'s slower than this one My local electronics store had no inventory for memory in Micro-SDHC format. Amazon fixed that problem.This came in quickly and was a breeze to install. It saved me $15 - and that was an added bonus.Now I can download all my music to my cell phone.Problem solved. thanks a lot sandisk good job works with adapter on nikon d800 flawless. non stop 20 min hd 1080p recording Writes and transfer data very fast SanDisk has always been a reliable product. SanDisk is one of the top of the line and proven electronic devices on the markets. Can\\'t go wrong... I\\'ve never had a problem, not saying something can happen but so far so good. GO SanDisk!!! Bought this one for the hubbys GPS, Works just great haven\\'t heard any complaints out of him since I installed it. :) thank you I have this in my Galaxy S 3 and it works great, I\\'ve had no problems with it. Highly recommend. I plugged this into my Samsung Galaxy 4 and it works great. When I plug the phone into the pc it is recognized and can easily transfer files. This card is recofnized by the phone and works as it should. I would recommend I ordered these to work in my GoPro Hero3 Black and they have worked well. They came with an SD memory card adapter - perfect for my high speed card readers. As with most things SanDisk it functions well and so far no issues.  Comes with the adapter which is a big plus. The space on this card is amazing.  Using this for a GoPro camera and it has been great so far. Bought this item to use in my Android based tablet and it has worked just fine.  Doubled my storage capacity at a very reasonable cost. I tried using the non-ultra models.  After one year one of the two stopped working completely (used in a Galaxy S3 phone).  We switched that one out for one of these a few months ago.  No issues.  Speed is more reliable also.  Highly recommended. Bought this for use in my Canon 60D camera.  Works great with no lag.  haven\\'t had a problem with it. Works great in my Samsung Galaxy S4.I also use a SanDisk card in my DroidX, after some bad experiences with another manufacturer\\'s 32GB micro-SD card that occasionally flaked out.Beware imitation cards that may look almost identical. I use this because my office use all window OS and I\\'m the only one with a MAC OS, so file transfers between computers are easy with this little thing Bought this to go with my Samsung Galaxy S III. It is class 10 which means it is fast. Works well. Much faster than my other microSD cards, most if which are class 4.  In a galaxy S3 now, fast enough not to slow it down when loading files/music/photos.  Did not Benchmark... Very fast, no problem in work. I\\'m very content with his performance, price and all of my file has enough space for the next year as well. Transfer speeds from just moving files to my phone as well as rooting and adding various roms was much faster than I\\'m used to. I haven\\'t done any official benchmarking though. No issues at all. I ended up utttingthis in my Samsung Galaxy S3 instead of my Tab2 like I had originally planned. I will be ordering another one soon. I bought this memory card for my smartphone (Nokia Lumia 521) when my older 8GB micro SD card died on me (amazon basics brand).I threw on some MP3s on there to listen on my phone on my trip up the California coast since I knew some areas wouldn\\'t have any radio or cell phone reception, and had no problems with it.I haven\\'t done any speed tests on it as I\\'m not using it for anything that needs extreme speeds. Its has more than enough speed for capturing video and and pictures.Its a great deal for the amount of storage and its price. plenty of memory for my gopro, durable, and small enough to lose haha... make sure your phone/device can handle it Used this in my old phone and it works great. Quick with transfer rates and loved it for the short amount of time I used it. Will probably use it for something else like a camera or something. What can I say, the card works perfectly, haven\\'t had a single issue with it. I had a sandisk card at one point that didn\\'t work properly and sandisks customer service was great in replacing my product which is the reason I will keep giving them my business. This came two days ahead of schedule and installed right away. The only peeve people might have is that it comes in so much packaging that I gave it to my friend Bruce Banner and he went all hulk on it and couldn\\'t get it open, so we had to use scissors like it says on the packaging. Should\\'ve read the instructions on the packaging first, now I have to buy a new house because it\\'s all smashed up. It\\'s a pretty cheap card and has a good amount of storage, but it has fairly slow write performance. Some competitors\\' MicroSD cards offer much faster performance for similar prices. I got this for my Galaxy S 2 phone and it worked right away. I had an issue with the write times slowing down after a month so I issued an exchange. It came promptly and my new SD card works great. I bought this for my GoPro hero3 Black and it works flawlessly. When capturing in 1080p 60fps it has no problem keeping data and writing. Never had any errors or malfunctions. I\\'ve even captured using 4k and had no problems. For the people saying this doesn\\'t work I\\'m guessing the problem isn\\'t with the card but with either your GoPro or computer.Overall this card works perfectly and is much cheaper on Amazon. Don\\'t bother buying in stores where they will charge you twice as much. My only problem is that I have not been able to use its full potential. Got it for my Samsung S5. Super tiny so don\\'t drop it or let your pet eat it.Great price, works, shipped safely. I noticed a long time ago that even when not really running at very fast speeds (and I\\'m mostly talking about reading as mostly it was playing music and video files) this card seems to get fairly warm.  After a while -- pretty much just outside the point at which I could RMA it -- it started randomly disconnecting.  At first I thought it was my phone though I had no clue why it would ever do such a thing, so I wouldn\\'t have sent it in at that point anyway.  It always seemed to be fine when I plugged it into my computer.  Over time it got worse and worse and I would have to remove and put it back in quite a few times to get it to finally work.  Eventually it started doing this on the computer too and that\\'s when I realized something was fishy.  I switched to another card in my phone and the problems went away.  On the other hand, this one stopped working completely a bit later even in the computer.Maybe I just got a bad one, but right now I\\'d rather get a different one instead if I were to buy a new one. This sd card was exactly what we were looking for. The last one we purchased got deleted and unformatted by the phone so we decided to replace it. This is a great price and came with the adapter too. I am hoping that I received a defective product and that my experience is rare, but this product did not work as intended. I was replacing another 32G micro sd card thinking that, because this is a Class 10 rated product, it would be faster. It never worked correctly. It kept dismounting unexpectedly, losing data, and was just not worth the money AT ALL! I ended up using my slower rated product which has worked reliably since the day I bought it. I only wish this product had done the same. I bought exactly the same micro SDHC SanDisk Ultra 32GB about a year ago and which I\\'m using daily. This stuff is reliable, it has never gave me any sort of problem. My setup for this card is like a hard drive in a PC where I Read/Write a lot of large amount of data everytime like video files, photos, maps, documents and it has been working flawlessly. Not an instance I recall that it failed me and also it is fast. My tablet is my PC now and I\\'m using it for several hours each day. All of my data are set to be read and written into this external disk. I couldn\\'t be more happier. I had use other brands in the past but somehow it didn\\'t meet my expectations. The new disk I ordered will be my backup copy just in case I lost my tablet. I purchased this as a recommendation to use with a LS300W dashcam.  Like most dashcams, there is constant high definition writing to the SD card because of needed looping.  This works as expected.  Reliable and fast. I think that this product by itself is a great product.  However, not all devices is built for microSD XC.  And not all devices like pad and phone that specifically states that it features microSD with compatability to microSD XC.  This happened to me.  Since I just bought a new pad, I thought that it would be compatible.  However, it did not.  the microSD XC is formatted with exFAT so my device can detect the hardware but it can\\'t write or read from it. I purhcased this card for my Hero 3 cam.  It worked all of last year, or the 3-4 times i used it.  I used it again this year and had some great once in a  life time ski videos and the card failed.  It could not be read or reformatted.  I lost all my vids.  It was strictly used in my hero 3 cam.  I pulled it out to try to retreive the vids using several PC\\'s, multiple card readers, and recovery software but no good. I have never known a card to fail and I am extremely disappointed.Try another brand.  Next time I will use multiple cards with smaller storage and a different brand. I have always purchased SanDisk products. This works alright it went bad in 2 months and sandisk replaced it. I have not had any issues with the replacement that Sandisk sent. Never had any issues with sandisk adapter card or devices. They work great and this one is no exception. Very small media for my big fingers but I manage. to do what I need to with it and it works well. Last thing is that Amazon\\'s prices are hard to beat! I bought two of the 32 GB Sandisk Ultra microSDHC cards, and both of them were unusable.The first one stopped accepting new data when I had put a bit less than one gig of data onto the card.  I couldn\\'t add more files, and I couldn\\'t reformat the card. If I tried to write a new file onto the card, the write operation seemed as if it worked, but the new data couldn\\'t be read back successfully.  The files already on the card were still readable, though, so basically, the card had become a 1 GB ROM.  Fortunately, there was no sensitive personal information on the card, so I returned it to Amazon.The second one didn\\'t fail the same way, but it was still unusable.  If I transferred a bunch of files and then read them back, most of the transferred files had data errors.  For example, a 3 minute music file might only be able to have it\\'s first minute of music played back, then the bad data would stop the music player.  I ran a write/readback test and confirmed that there were data errors on nearly every block tested.  (I used Flash_Drive_Tester_v114.exe, which is a free download.)I ended up buying the equivalent Transcend productTranscend Information TS32GUSDC10 32GB micro SDHC10 Flash Memory - No Box or Adapterwhich has been performing flawlessly.  I have over half of the capacity in use, and I\\'ve never seen any sign of data loss or corruption.  For USB plug in flash drives, I\\'ve had good luck with SanDisk products, but my experience with the SanDisk microSDHC cards has been terrible. I can say that SanDisk is one of the best company in the fields of electronics and Digital Cameras, but I am very dissapointed of this Memory Card.The card memory is only 25GB and the speed is 14MB/s which is not as advertised.I gave it to my dad to use it on his phone and I started to use the Sony 32GB MicroSD. I can say that it works perfectly: the storage is 32GB and the speed is 43MB/s.Buy it now: http://amzn.to/1iGqMVm . This is the exact link I used to buy mine. As advertised this guy holds some serious stuff in its innards. Solves my issues and is quite speedy. Would suggest. Came pre-formatted and easy to install. Came with adapter which is great. I recommend this if you are looking for a micro memory card, very worth the price. I use this product with the GoPro 3 Black Edition. It works fantastic, even at 2.7K resolution, and imports very fast, especially over USB 3 card readers. I almost always go with SanDisk these days for flash RAM; they invented much of it and it shows. I bought this a little under a year ago to use with my laptop. Worked just as advertised for much of that time until it stopped letting me write or delete stuff from it (could read just fine). I couldn\\'t even format it. So it kinda just sat there for a while. After trying to format it a number of different ways, I finally contacted sandisk, and they said they will send me a replacement free of charge. I would have maybe given this a lower rating, but the customer service from sandisk made up for the faulty card. I am just glad it fell under a warranty period (I think). Had the card not failed, I would have given five stars. If sandisk wouldn\\'t replace it, would have given one star. Hopefully the latter doesn\\'t happen to you I will probably never take it out of my tablet, because it is so hard to get a hold of, but it installed and is working fast.  I did not use the adapter, good to have in case I need it. It works like it\\'s supposed to. No lost files yet and it\\'s big storage for it\\'s microness. Class 10, highest class so far! Great microsdhc card,  use it on my phone for extra storage.  I have used this brand in the past and it works great.  Never a problem with ScanDisk. I love that you can get these things so cheap from Amazon, vs. getting them at the major electronic stores for double the price.  It works perfectly, and streams/downloads/uploads very quickly!  I love the adapter that comes with it, too; so I can use it for transferring files from a computer/notebook faster than a 3.0 USB/Thumbdrive/dongle.  Great buy! This item works great as expected without any issues. I would recommend this item for anyone in need. Good buy. My new Android phone (T-Mobile upgrade) has a Micro SD slot, but did not come with any card installed. When I read that it could take up to 32 GB, I searched for the best deal and this was it! Super fast, great price, couldn\\'t be happier! :-) Fits in my new Samsung Note 3.  Holds lots of music and data.  I like Sandisk as a brand and this is no exception.  Oh, did I mention I bought a second one for my son too. Excellent item for the price. Class 10 is the way to go if you\\'re uploading or copying files to your computer. I have a 32gb as well and they both work well. No issues. Very good card and still working now in my car DVR i love it and hoping it working for a long time for me. Great product, great price, great quality!  I\\'ve purchased 6 of these so far for family and friends.The only thing better than this would be a 128gb model!I only wished that laptops came with micro SD slots! Great product, great speed, no hassle, plug and play. Up to now sandisk products have always been reliable for me hope this keeps up to it\\'s brand. It\\'s unreal that 64 GB of data fit in this small of a memory card. Not too long ago this was considered futuristic. :) I put this in my Android to hold pictures music and all other items.  It works like a charm and a lot of room still for memory.  This is blazing fast too.  I am happy with this. Very pleased with the speed and performance of this memory card.  Use it in both my camera and smart phone. SanDisk makes the most reliable SD cards. After working in Tech support for a company that relied on maps loaded on SD cards, I only recommend SanDisk now. Class 10 is great, it means you have the fastest card made. The class shows the minimum speeds for data transfer to and from the card. a class 10 will always have at least a minimum transfer of 10mb/sec. These are the cards professionals use to record HD video and high quality images. Bought this at a very good bargain from Amazon and the cards performed amazingly great on my devices. Definitely worth the purchase. Thumbs up for the good buy. Any SanDisk product I\\'ve ever purchased worked very well and this one is no different.  I use this in my Sony Experia Z1S from Tmobile and I\\'ve had no problems.  SanDisk is a trusted brand, this paired with the great price and Amazon Prime eligibility, it is a no-brainer purchase if you\\'re looking for more data for your device. works perfectly well with my Galaxy s4! before use, i put the micro sd card into the adapter and put it into my laptop, connected my phone to my laptop, transfered all my stuff from one sd card to the other, and it worked well, i still have all my stuff... with PLENTY of room to spare... and now with the S4 you can save your apps onto ur sd card, so whatever i can save on my sd card instead of the actual phone memory, i save... now both have a lot of free memory =] very happy with this purchase. have had it for a while now. There\\'s really not much to say. I put it right into my S4 when it arrived and have not had any issues ever since. Very nice card with plenty of room for my music, photos, videos, and whatever else I cram on my phone. Got this for my samsung galaxy s4 and its super nice to have. The space allows me to fit so much on this phone that it can hold everything I want. Had an entire season of Seinfeld on there for those boring times and lots and lots of music. Great buy its a micro sd card and it works. What more can you ask for.I have one for each of my electronic devices. This card performs much better than the lower class 4 and 6 cards I have used in the past.  I have around 400 pictures on it, as well as quite a bit of other content. Content loads very quickly on my Android phone.  Very happy with this purchase. This was a great fast card and I had no issues with it. My GS3 recognized it quickly and still works a year later. the microSD card works wonderfully with my galaxy tab3 and gives me a great deal of extra storage for my media on the tablet I had to format it as FAT32, you can google for how to do that, but once you do, it works great.  I\\'ll never understand why people would ever buy a phone that doesn\\'t have a microSD slot.  With this you can fill it up with whatever you want, such as movies, TV shows, music, and share it with whoever you want.  Just pop it in your phone and you are all set for a long trip, airplane ride, etc.  I never need to worry about running out of space when taking full HD videos either. I bought this 64GB memory card for my mini-camcorder.  Now I have unlimited picture and video taking capabilities.  No more packing extra memory cards for me. I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S4 because it had little available memory on board. Unfortunately the phone doesn\\'t allow for the user to move apps to the sd card, but that isn\\'t the card\\'s fault, it\\'s the phone\\'s fault. The card itself works great and seems to transfer very quickly, my full 1080p HD videos have no trouble recording directly to the card. It works, fairly fast, definitely not 30MB/s fast when copying off of it via a USB 3.0 adapter, and absolutely much slower when writing to it. But that\\'s true about all of these memory cards, it\\'s just some are worse than others. So far this has outlasted my 32gb scandisk micro, faster data transfer and my phone seems to breathe, highly recommend the ultra over the regular This micro SD card holds quite a bit of stuff. Not all my stuff, but most of my stuff. I like that. Works, had to give a review of this since it does exactly what is it advertised to! Good buy for anyone! Works perfect in my note 3. This card even writes almost as fast as my internal phone storage! It works much better than cheap Chinese cards. I\\'ve also tried it in my go pro, and it has plenty of write speed, even enough for shooting in 4K! I highly recommend it, and will definitely be getting another soon. I purchased this MicroSD card to record extended 1080p videos and it has worked flawlessly. Camera did not immediately recognize the card, but going into the settings and selecting format solved the problem. Great little card.  The only problem I have experienced may not even be related to the card, but Android OS itself.  I experience buffering/\\'hiccups\\'/pauses when watching a video if I also have my utorrent client in the background downloading.  I am not sure if this is limited to the card itself and possibly a faster write speed is needed, or it\\'s the fault of the phone\\'s OS.  However, I am confident that it\\'s operating within spec.Card looks good too.. too bad it\\'s in the case of my phone never to be seen. i bought this a while back and have had no complaints at all. fast, reliable and no hickups. and at a decent price as well will be coming back for another. This is an ultra fast SanDisk branded SD card that\\'s great for digital cameras, especially for video. I got it for my smartphone, mainly for the 32 GB capacity, and it fills the bill at a very low price with Prime shipping. You can\\'t get better quality flash cards than SanDisk. I\\'m still amazed that they can cram such a huge amount of memory on such a tiny chip.  One megabyte of data in text from printed out would fill a pickup truck. This chip has 32 thousand megabytes.  Think about having 32,000 pickup trucks full of text in a chip smaller than your pinky fingernail! The card I received works perfectly in my Samsung Note 2. It comes with a converter to normal SD size, and I used it to copy music and photos from my iMac to the card. It picked up straight away in my mobile device and works fast enough for taking pictures and videos with the mobile.Delivery was fast as usual from Amazon, and packaging was good.On a sidenote, I own a couple of DSLR cameras and generally prefer the SanDisk brand for my memory cards. I\\'ve seen other brands fail at the most inappropriate of times, but never had a failure on a SanDisk. Installed it in my Contour camera and it works just swell for taking 1080p HD video at 30FPS. Can\\'t complain, can\\'t say much more. Good stuff. Was hesitant to purchase but then my \\'regular\\' phone sd card died and so decided to go for this class 10 for my tablet... excellent choice. This was ordered as extra memory for my wif\\'e\\'s tablet. Provides lots of extra space for storage, beyond the onboard RAM. Good micro SD card. I love SanDisk\\'s products because they have a  good warranty policy. I would recommend this product. Works as expected, no problems, second time I purchased this item, happy with purchase. Cheapest price I found for Sandisk. this small but big in memory will be the perfect gift for a samsung tablet.i am pretty sure she will love it. Awesome microSD card.. no issues and I have several of these and has performed well in my gopro, SG4 and Note 2. Works perfectly with my GoPro 3.  No issues with write times and works as expected.  No issues with losing anything stored or corruption, which is highly important for anything camera related. I love this. I am using it to add additional storage space to my MB AIR together with the minidrive. I may not have comparable speed to an actual SSD but for audio files and photos it is good. there is a lot of fake memory being sold right now, this is legit, works, and is the stated capacity. It benchmarked as fast as my device is (~10 mb/sec) This is my devices limitation not the cards I\\'m sure it is faster in devices that support higher speeds. Used it for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 tablet.  Stopped working after about 10 months without warnings.  My tablet now recognizes as blank or un-formatted card; my computers won\\'t even recognize it at all!  I am still trying to recover some priceless photos of my kids since my last backup of the card... As soon as I learned that my Nokia Lumia 1520 would gladly accept 128Gb MicroSD card, I sought one out. The $119 promo price on Amazon had evaporated along with the stock of the rare cards! The price had skyrocketed to nearly $200, AND THEY WERE OUT OF STOCK!? I pined. I whined. Then, one day, in early May, there it was! Back on Amazon, for the awesome price point of $119! I pulled the trigger immediately! Well, apparently the cards were on backorder, but in was a short wait. Four days later, I had my card. After formatting it via the phone, ands changing all my phone settings to save everything to the card, I\\'m a happy camper. Read/write speeds are good, and the only really noticible lag is when taking photos, but that has a lot to do with my choosing to take photos with a 5Mp \"low rest\" version, and a corresponding 16Mp RAW version,, too. Other than that, this drive has allowed me to store >1Gb apps(games), (of which I have many), and tons of pics, and 1080p videos! I\\'d say, that if your phone accepts 128Gb cards, this is a no brainer! I have tested dozens of SDHC and micro-SDHC cards. One disturbing trend I noticed is that: the speed class rating for micro-SDHC is typically inflated. For example, a \\'class-10\\' rating means the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least 10MB/s. But somehow, a class-10 microSDHC cards is always slower than a class-10 SDHC card from the same manufacturer. Case in point: thePNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)claims to be \\'class-10\\', yet it can only write at 8.6MB/s maximum, while the full-sizePNY P-SDHC16G10achieved 13.4MB/s according to CrystalDiskMark v3.01.ThisSanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 card (SDSDQUA-032G-U46A), however, proves to be the exception. It achieved a sequential write speed of over 10MB/s according to two different benchmark programs (11.8MB/s in \"CrystalDiskMark\", 10.6MB/s in \"H2testw v1.4\"). This is faster than all my other microSDHC cards, including two \\'class-10\\' cards fromPNYandPolaroid.A closer look at the file transfer speed using \"Flash Memory Toolkit\" revealed another nice surprise: For writing small files, this Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card performed just as well as its full-size counterpart, theSanDisk Ultra SDHC (SDSDU-032G-AFFP). In contrast, all my other class-10 microSDHC cards perform poorly while writing smaller files. See the benchmark results I uploaded to \\'Customer Images\\' for details.When you use a memory card in a digital camera to record HD video, it needs to store a huge video file each session. That means its sequential write speed is most critical. When used in a tablet or a smart phone, however, the card\\'s random write speed for small files is more important. That\\'s why in such applications, the Sandisk microSDHC will perform faster than the PNY and Polaroid cards, even though they are also rated as \\'class-10\\'.[Bottom Line]As of this writing, the Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card ia actually priced lower than other class-10 cards from PNY and Polaroid. This makes the Sandisk the best value - especially if you need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.[Side Notes]- Do not confuse this Sandisk Ultra card withSanDisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC (SDSDQY-032G-U46A). The latter is rated for class-6 only.- The size of this \\'32GB\\' card is 29.7GB according to my computer. This is actually normal because computer people count one Gig as \"2 to the power 30\", which is 7.3% larger than one billion. So 29.7GB translates to 31.9 billion bytes, which is \\'32GB\\' according to marketing people.[Update on Feb 4, 2013]1. Amazon combined the Sandisk Ultra 32GB and 64GB cards on the same product page. Please beware that your intended appliance must be compatible with \\'SDXC\\' in order to used the 64GB version. My original review refers to the 32GB \\'SDHC\\' version.2. There are two part numbers for the same card. If you start from the Amazon product page and select \\'Retail Packaging\\', you\\'ll see the part number of SDSDQUA-032G-U46A. But if you click on \\'Frustration Free Package\\', the part number changes to SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A.[Update on Oct 5, 2013]The Sandisk microSDHC card works great in my new Samsung Galaxy S3, without the need for reformat (the default format is FAT32)[Update on Dec 26, 2013]My old test results were limited by the card reader and USB 2.0 port used. I re-tested the Sandisk UHS1 micro card using theTranscend RDF5 Card Readerconnected to an USB 3.0 port. Here are the results from \\'CrystalDiskMark 3.01 x64\\':- Sequential Read speed = 40.0MB/s (was 34.8MB/s when connected to USB 2.0 port)- Sequential Write speed = 13.1MB/s (was 12.6MB/s when connected to USB 2.0 port) I got this for my new phone. It works as expected. I don\\'t worry about the speed in these things. I loaded up all my music on it & my phone stores my pictures on it. So far I have not had any issues with this micro sd card. While not quite as fast as I was expecting it to be, it works perfectly and smoothly.  I bought this for my new Droid Razr when we moved to a new carrier.  It did take a few minutes for my computer to recognize it, causing me to think the card was bad, but it eventually did recognize it and allowed me to move everything from my previous card to it  (via the desktop).  I also put a few movies on it and so far, watching them on the phone has been flawless and smooth.  It\\'s only been in my phone for a few weeks, but I have no complaints what-so-ever at this point.  Excellent card. Plugged this little gem into my 1520 and now have a huge amount of memory for video, kindle downloads, and music. spoke with customer service had it replaced 3 times, card had problems all of the times, they were all the time looking for ways to get out of the warranty until they decided i did something which obviously wasn\\'t the problem because it happened 3 times with the previous cards, basically look into other companies that honer their warranties,very sad usually very good cards,they kept saying that Samsung updated the software and they update it in ways that it wont match the Sandisk cards.?? Bought these for my FineVu CR-500HD dash cam, my cam cannot take cards greater than 32GB and found this to be the most consistently performing card for my use.I now get almost double the recording content vs. the 16GB card that came with the dash cam. If you need a card with no maintenance and performs with no issues, this is the card to get. love it makes my tablet work so much faster,because it take up alot of memory that would be on the Internal storage,,free\\'s alot of space, I\\'ve got a bunch of music and movies downloaded on this Micro card and only using about 1/4 of it memory. thanks I would recommend this,to anyone whole loves music and movies on the GO! Not all memory cards are the same.  Class 10 means faster transfers.  This one is even faster.  Works as promised. Storing my images and videos as it should on my Note 3. No issues here at all as some have stated. Possible they received a bad batch? Pro:  &#9642;PriceCons:  &#9642;intially began to get card read errors on Samsung Note.  Right at 6 months it fails, lossing all my data.  Pictures, videos, documents, ect...  all gone.I shouldn\\'t have cheaped out, I should have bought the samsung card. As to be expected this SanDisk works as advertised in my Garmin 850 GPS. I am satisfied with this product. I bought this card to expand the memory in my Note II. Works well, no complaints so far. Will probably purchase a 64 GB when this one fills up. So far, so good. No complaints, does what it is supposed to do. Purchased for my android phone to provide more media storage.  The one I received was DOA.  Spoke with SanDisk tech support who confirmed that it was a bad unit.  Since it was within 30 days, they suggested I return it to Amazon instead of going through warranty procedures.  I returned it to Amazon, but made the mistake of requesting a replacement instead of a refund.  The replacement appeared to work at first, but after a short while, it caused my phone to reboot, files went missing and displayed other forms of instability.  It was a bit late to return again, so I contacted Sandisk who replaced the unit under the warranty.  However, this all took a lot of time, necessitated repeated copying of many GBs of data and secure erasing of information.The warranty replacement from SanDisk works well, so far.  However, I\\'m not seeing much improvement in my application over a similar 32GB Class 4 SanDisk microSDHC (this one is class 10).  Would probably give the current unit 3 stars, but this rating is for the Amazon delivered units (both defective).If you do get a bad one, I\\'d suggest to return for refund, not replacement. I have a number of SanDisk memory products and they have been 100% reliable. This microSD is no exception. I purchased this memory specifically because it was the largest microSD memory currently available. i am using it for removable data storage on a Windows SurfacePro2 to free on-board SSD drive memory. Reviews of the SurfacePro2 didn\\'t verify compatibility of the 128GB microSD but the SurfacePro2 immediately recognized it and it operates flawlessly. This works great for added memory on my new Asus T100 tablet/laptop.  It came with a 64gb hard drive and now with this I have 128gb. Get a fast card for your gadgets, this is a class 10.  Higher the number the faster the read/write it is and sandisk is a well know reputable name.  I would avoid the cheap junk as if it fails then you\\'ve lost what\\'s on the card most likely! $20. less money than comparable Samsung. Very fast. Installs easily. Would recommend to a friend. Also, I appreciate the &#34;user friendly&#34; packaging. Fungible micro SD card that works as expected.  Now for filler text to get past the idiotic word count minimum. failed in one month.  Sandisk very promptly replaced, great customer service, and the new card seems to work ok.  I have read that there are some problems with the galaxy s3 so it may not have been the memory module\\'s fault it failed. Short and sweet: I\\'ve never had an issue with SanDisk media and this one has been solid as well. I have SanDisk media in all of my countless electronic gadgets. cant complain about anything sandisk.  I buy this product anytime I need a memory card.. prices are decent and storage capacity is as well Using this in my Galaxy S4 and it works fairly well. I\\'ve transfered a bunch of files from the PC via a usb 3.0 memory card reader and ya know, it\\'s not blazing fast but it\\'s pretty good for what it is. It\\'s certainly a lot more tolerable than pretty much any other microSD card I\\'ve used.That said, you get a minimum write speed that\\'s good enough for 1080p video on a cell phone or other mobile device and will probably lead to faster times between shots if you use it in a camera phone, if for no other reason than it takes less time to write the picture you just took to the disk vs say a cheaper sd card.It\\'s a microSD card, I haven\\'t had any problems. Go for it. This one works just like it\\'s supposed to work.  Fast response on delivery and the adapter fits the standard memory card reader. It\\'s a memory card and performs like it should: it stores data. I would recommend it for cameras and any other device that calls for storage with a SD card and adapter. Works as advertised, no issues to date.  There are faster cards out there but you will pay more for them. Purchased this for my GoPro HD Hero 3 Silver. It works extremely quick. No problems with recording videos or taking pictures on. I would buy it again. Got it exactly what it was displayed and described. bought this directly through amazon at USD 60 only for my samsung captivate glide. all u need to do is to format it with your phone and voila! 59gb (to be exact when calc in bytes)! not a big fan for the transfer speed but it does satisfy my desire of putting one in my phone. buying thru amazon bulk purchase is cheaper but requires u to wait longer for the shipment. but for my case it was faster than expected. a very happy customer. :) I use this in my Midland Action Cam for hunting and fishing. I rely on Sandisk because of it\\'s quality. I have over a dozen different memory cards and of all the brands, I like Sandisk the best. Never an issue Bought this to use in my Canon Elph 520HS digital camera.  Works fine right out of the box.  I probably did not need this much capacity, but why worry? It works great and transfers quickly. I use it on my Dell Venue Tablet and my Polaroid XS100 action camera. Quick shipment, product as described.  Comes with adapter which will come in handy.  SanDisk is a great product, it usually delivers quality item. reasonable price, good quality. not much more needs to be said. It appears that the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Micro SD Card I purchased from Amazon was defective.  I installed it in my Samsung Tablet, but could not successfully transfer files using either a USB cable or WiFi.  The file transfer would appear to start, but then would slow down and hang completely.  It did this on every one of multiple attempts, with different file types, and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file.  I tried loading files onto the card directly from my PC, but then the Tablet would not see them.  I tried reformatting the card both in my PC and in the Tablet, but still got the same result.  After a few tries, the Tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blank/unformatted.  I did an A/B/A with an old 8GB Sandisk Micro SD Card that I had laying around.  It worked perfectly -- formating, transferring files, reading and writing files -- everthing worked.  I put the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Card back in the Tablet, but had the same problems again.  I concluded that the SanDisk Ultra card was defective and returned it.  I\\'m still using the old 8GB card without a hiccup.The good thing was that Amazon\\'s return policy was quick and painless. I have no issues with this Micro SD.  I purchased it for use with a video camera and it does everything I would expect without any problems.  Wouldn\\'t hesitate to purchase again. I bought the memory to my lumia 620 and it works. It\\'s really faster than my previous microsd (Class 4). No complaints, i\\'m very happy with my purchase. The name should speak for itself! It comes with a regular SD card adapter. If one day you feel that you have no need for a microSD card then just simply put it back into the adapter and use it as a regular SD card for your camera or other electronics that takes a form of a regular SD card. It reads and write very fast, which it should since it\\'s a class 10 card! I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it\\'s a nice addition to storing those big 1080p files & MP3 music loads. Hands down the best brand in the industry for SD cards! I highly recommend it! Installation on my Surface was simple and added a lot more storage to my tablet. I liked the SD adapter so that I can use it like a mini USB drive from my larger PC. excelent Failed after one month and the problem is epidemic on the sandisk forums , they slowly get corrupted then fail and report only 30-32mb size.The Lifetime warranty is nice, but these products are clearly defective , I\\'m in the process of RMA now, will update post on status updates.DO NOT TRUST YOUR DATA WITH THIS PRODUCT, KEEP A BACKUP OF EVERYTHING YOU PUT ON IT, I\\'M 100% serious, just look at the sandisk \\'users\\' forum for 64gb cards.Here is my breakdown while it lastedSanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1Write speed  was 8-10 Mb/s (usually 8, tested windows usb 3.0 reader, and android)Read speed 27 mb/sFAILED @ 1 1/2 monthsUpdate 2-13-14Received back replacement item in brand new condition readspeed is 40+mb/s write speed is still around 10-12mb/s - RMA turn around time was about 3 weeks, I will up rating if this one lasts longer then one month.Update 5-1-14RMA replacement is still going strong, upped the star rating by one point. The right size for the GoPro black! its a sandisk ultra card. all i can say is that it records data for my go pro without problems. Just as with many other reviewers here, my card worked perfectly for the first week and a half, and then suddenly lost its format and could no longer be reformatted, while at the same time overheating dangerously. Sandisk is currently issuing an RMA to replace it, but I am worried that the replacement could also end up being defective. As is evident from the 1-star reviews here, the rate of such defects for these cards is about 10%, which to me seems like an absolutely unacceptable number for a memory card for a major manufacturer. And it\\'s not like Sandisk hasn\\'t had a heads-up on this problem -- the negative reviews have been there for quite a while. Clean up your act, SanDisk! Excellent product at a great price. I use it with Asus Transformer Pad 700 and it works great. Speed is high enough to  ply high definition video from it. Very good and quality memory with good functions. I received it in record time from the seller and so far i have not had any issues with the memory card. Purchased two of these to use in my surface pro.  loaded one with 60 gigs of movies and one with 60 gigs of music.  Small form factor means easy to transport.Both work flawlessly in my Surface Pro.Redirected my itunes music to the d: drive and therefore using none of my Pro storage space for movies or music.Plays movies and music perfect to my Pro device.....no waits....no slow downs.....just pure streaming from the sandisk to my screen........ happy........Of course I have skydive, iCloud, and amazon cloud but sometimes you are away from fast wifi or just simply do not want to use any of your processing speed to stream....this enables me to have content available at a whim. works great in a Samsung phone. Easy to use, get to, and can take some punishment...i\\'ll be buying more soon 64GB microSDX class 10 memory card. I use it as external storage for my Samsung Galaxy Note II phone. So far it has worked great. Many have complained that the hero3 requires a high quality mSD card. Picked up this one for a great price on Amazon, and have not had any issues with my camera freezing up or not recording as desired. Transfer rates were as advertised. Also loaded it at one point with 30 or so xvid movies for my daughters to watch on an ASUS epad transformer and it worked perfectly. Highly recommend. Works like a charm.  I originally thought this was expensive and bought an off brand card, which ended up being junk.  I returned it, spent the extra $15 on this card and it is awesome.  I have it in a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 (SMT310), and watch movies, read books (pdf), and listen to music on it.  Since I travel a lot I will end up buying a couple of these, that way I won\\'t even need to take a full size laptop with me. I dunno if it\\'s a bad copy or what but When I try to transfer files like 2GB or 3GB it doesn\\'t copy! It ejects itself and then mounts itself again. I had to transfer all my songs from my PC through Airdroid which was a pain in the a$$ I can\\'t transfer movies from my PC and by the way I tried formatting it and checking for some errors but same issue but I can move smaller files like 20MB or soVery disappointing especially for such price!UPDATE: Now I have more problems! My phone tells me every now and then that the \"SD card was unexpectedly removed\" and I tried on other phones with the same problem This memory card is the best, I\\'ve downloaded it all kinds of information, without problem, and their ability to cover all my expectations. The negative is the adapter that does not work properly on the computer Fast. Sleek. Small. Not really much to say about a microSDHC... Most of you buying this knows what they do. I have other SD cards that begin to act a little buggy over time. All of my SanDisk cards are still running great, this card included. What can you say about SanDisk?  They always work and perform the way they are met to do.  Got this for my Samsung Tab 10.1 and it works flawlessly. THIS CARD DIED IN LESS THAN ONE MONTH IN MY SIII LOST 400 PICTURES VALUABLE PICTURES AND INFORMATION DO NOT BUY. I love the class 10 uhs memory card thank you onedog Class 10 16 gb perfect for my phone. Never use anything less than a class 10 in a phone because you will have lag times waiting for the card to respond, for $13 shipped to your front door how can you go wrong? SanDisk has been good for me for many years. Recommended. Purchased this to go with my spouse\\'s new Sony tablet, he is happy because unlike me, he doubts he will every fill it up.  I on the other hand will use his tablet to take photos and such.  Now, I don\\'t have to worry about missing that surprise shot when my tablet isn\\'t around and his is. using this in my s3 and its great. movies , music and more picture taking . wat else is there to say Very easy to install and works in my Samsung Galaxy Pro 10.1 from the get go.great way to add storage. SanDisk has always provided me with a reliable memory product. In the case of this 32 GB card, it went into a Samsung Note 8.0 and my wife could not be more pleased.PROS: Reputable brand, priceCONS: none noted. Well i\\'m not a experienced product reviewer when it comes to such memory card kind of thing. Everything seems fine. Delivery time was on time. Writing speed reading speed is normal. I didn\\'t expect adapter would come with it. That\\'s plus 1 star. The only reason i\\'m giving four star is battery drain of my phone. When I filled this card with almost 15 GBs of music and put it in my phone, my phone\\'s battery was draining very very quickly. Is it supposed to be like this? I\\'m not sure if it\\'s phone\\'s or this card\\'s faulty. I.ve never been experienced such thing before. So if anyone knows the solution and explanation for this situation I hope U will enlighten me pls. Otherwise this product seems solid and legit. It\\'s an SD Card that works great.  Big storage, and writes fast enough for me.  Not much to complain about. Can\\'t tel you much about it. Its a memory card and I can\\'t compare it to other products out there. I put it in my new Roku 2 XS and it seemed to work - that is, it recognized and formatted it. I\\'m hoping to use my Roku for music and video. I suppose that mostly I\\'ll be streaming but I thought I\\'d give myself the option of locally storing some of the media. Pros: Looks good, works fine until it starts acting up.Cons : Worked for 6-8 months in 2 Samsung S3 phones, and 3 months in a Samsung Galaxy Note 8. One by one they all died, became unreadable. Cannot format either. Just dead. Wasted.Sandisk did not post any disclaimers like don\\'t bother to use this in a Samsung device. works in the note 3 cant complain at all. the price is sweet. amazon is the best. thank you. thats all Good quality memory card. Have used it with the GoPro Hero 3 and works flawlessly. Wished all electronics were this simple San Disk is alway a brand name that I know I can trust. I have never had a problem with any San Disk memory card that I have purchased. Had a 16GB card in my S4 and my wife didn\\'t have a memory card in her S3, so I bought a couple of these for us. I needed a bigger card because I load custom ROMs and such and she needed one for her media. They work great and have a pretty nice capacity! I was able to add 10 full length movies at 720p for my phone with no problem with this chip. Must have for long airplane trips. SanDisk Ultra 32GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS...;  Item is as described.  decent product for its price and quality.  It comes with the small Sd card and a next size up adapter Thank you very much, I\\'m very satisfied and pleased with the product I purchased, I recommend this vendor for their reliability, diligence and quality of their products, in my grateful and happy client.OSWALDO ARTIAGA I made the mistake of buying a supposed 64gig card on Ebay and found that it was fake. So, I decided to purposely buy a retail packaged SandDisk card directly from Amazon. The card is great, I reformatted it to fat32 for use with my Sansa clipzip and Hisoundaudio Studio V 3rd Anniversary. I have not had any problems with the card, works as advertised and the transfer speeds are great when loading files onto the card. Got this for my cell phone, most likely more storage than I will ever need but at this price going with a lower capacity chip just wouldn\\'t save that much money and didn\\'t make sense.  Exactly as pictured - worked without a problem. I put this in my Samsung Skyrocket phone.  Even though the phone says 32 GB  max, it still recognized and formatted the card.  Its great to have all of that space.However, any time i try to use the USB mass storage mode to transfer files, it errors out.  I thought it was the phone since it was larger than the max spec, but then I tried it in a USB card reader I had.  It still errored out trying the same files.  Finally, I had to put it in the adapter, and stick it in a card reader built into a laptop and transfer the files that way.I think the issue was that using the USB 2.0 the files were writing too fast and faulting out and with the laptop, transferring the files from the wireless network and then to the card, the transfer speed was slow enough that it was successful.  Took all night to get my stuff on the card though.I use it mostly for pics and video on my phone also, works great.  The phone seems to have no trouble accessing anything on the card and it seems  plenty fast for it even when recording high def video which i do a lot of for work. it has been awesome, and just enough in size. I have been putting movies in the range of 900mb to 3.5 gb. No issues. Also plays lossless music with no issues as well. Great memory card, I love the fact that this came in frustration free packaging. And even better, it also came with an SD adapter for free! Thanks a bunch amazon and SanDisk. Works well in our tablets and phones La uso sul mio samsung galaxy tab 2 7 e va benissimo, raramente non la riconosce, ma basta estrarla rimetterla e tutto va a posto, se fosse spesso sarebbe un problema, ma ripeto succede raramente perci&ograve; consigliata!!! This card is so small and yet holds this much storage. No problems with speed or reliability. Can definitely recommend. Bypass the &#34;cheaper&#34; clones and get SanDisk. Your  data is wprth much more than the little that you &#34;save&#34; using the cheap imitations. Trust me, I just found that out for myself. i just had an incident with my Galaxy S3 phone however where the chip became corrupt.. Is it the chip? Is it the phone?  I put one of these in my Samsung phone and another in my Samsung Tablet.  All is well except for that one time where the chip and phone got funny with each other and I had to erase all my music... The phone was able to format / erase / prepare the chip so it was immediately usable but I did lose my music.  Very weird.  Well, all I have to do is sync my music to my phone.. No big deal.. Hasn\\'t even blinked in my MP3 player, and gave me loads of room for expanding my library.  I trust the SanDisk name with all my electronic gear. One of the benefits of having an Android phone is being able to have external storage. I popped this in my phone, moved my apps over, and added some FLAC, movies, and more.I added a selection of movies, and then never watched them. Then I was on a flight across the Atlantic and everyone fell asleep around me, and I remembered that I had added all these HD movies! That alone justified the purchase.Do yourself a favor and add some extra storage to your phone/whatever. The card was perfect.Bought it for my Virgin Moble Smart phone as it only had a 2 gig card in it.Their Geek squad told me I needed a larger card as my memory to download applications was almost out!! (Only had 2 dowloads on it!!!).After purchasing and  inserting the expensive card, I got the same screen --- can not download applicationas memory is almost filled.Turned out the memory card has no bearing on applications being downloaded - they are  stored on internal built in memory.Seems the phone I was suggested to purchase only has 2 gigs of internal memory.Was not told to me when I got it After I inserted the micro SD card to the adapter I can no longer removed it from the adapter. It was stuck inside the adapter permanently. I definitely received a defective item. I also read a lot of reviews saying this card have bad sectors.Another, while I was transferring from my computer the transferring of files suddenly stopped and said there was an error.Sandisk\\'s quality control department should up their game. They\\'re selling products to the general public that are defective and flawed (not all of them BUT a lot of them). It\\'s just not me. I also read a lot of reviews saying the card they got were also defective. It could just be my phone a Galaxy S3 but I have this MicroSD card in my phone and a 32 gb microcenter version in my wife\\'s phone and the 32 th version benchmarks faster than this card. Not by much but it is slightly faster. Again this could just be my phone. One thing I do have a problem with is the fit of the microSD card in the holder/adapter. It is a very tight fit. If I put the card in a different holder/adapter it slides in and out with out problem. The one it came with really holds onto the card. this works great on my Galaxy S4 right out of the box.and its faster then the old 32gb card i used to have. Received the product in 3 days even though it was shipped with free shipping with a number of other items.  Using it for my new cell phone to store pictures, movies, etc. and moved everything from my old phone with a mobile reader also purchased with this item.  Everything worked flawlessly. This disk is great. Really fast read and write, no lag time at all. Using it with go pro black.  Also comes with an adaptor that fits in your computer. Extremely easy install for Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.  Gives me fast easy storage for movies and games.  Everything you could want from a micro SD. With a little work, this card is an excellent way to inexpensivly upgrade the storage space on your Surface RT or Surface Pro. All you need to do is reformat the card as NTFS and add a virtual hard drive (done in Disk Managment) Once that\\'s done, you have an extra 32GB of space for very little money! Worked in my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S3. Didn\\'t need to format, plugged it right in and worked instantly. Great capacity, not the fastest transfer rate. Went about 6-8mbps loading all the files onto it (music mostly). I used these in a home brew project where speed was a major driving factor.  I used two of these in a raid adapter and they were just awesome. Did exactly what I expected.  Not worth spending a ton of money on one of these.  This gets the job done without any issues. rec and was happy.  good price, but we get want we pay for. the scan dic. would no por matt I noticed that I was constantly running out of space on my Smartphone. I checked the SD card and it was a 16Gb, but was about 98% full with pictures, music, and applications that I downloaded over time. I decided to get a bigger SD card for the phone. I researched online and found that my phone will support a 32Gb card, so I bought this one. Works great! All I had to do was copy and paste (via my computer) all the information from the old SD card ot this one. My Smartphone picked it up right away and I didn\\'t lose anything, AND now I have twice as much room. I think the only thing I had to reset was my ring tones (because the wave files I was using were on my old SD card, and somehow the link between ring tone and file didn\\'t match up), but other than that, everything else worked fine. This is a well manufactured memory card which keeps up with demanding a/v transfer rates.  After 60 days of heavy usage, I\\'ve had no issues whatsoever. I\\'ve had this for about a week now and so far no problems. Due to my laziness, I didn\\'t do a lot of research beforehand and didn\\'t find out about the problem these cards had with the Galaxy S4, which is the phone I have, until after I had bought the card (apparently the cards kept unmounting themselves, even if you remounted it in the settings). Fortunately, SanDisk caught wind of the problem a couple months ago and fixed it, so kudos to them. I used this in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0, and transfer rates are pretty good when going straight through USB. It does act a little peppier however when plugged straight into a card reader. great fit and works great fit right into my phone without any problem just like one i would have gotten from (their store) but cheaper on here amazon I got this for my ELPH 520-HS camera. Amazing capacity for such small size. I also got the adapter so that I could download all the photos directly, and quickly, into my computer without needing a cable. item i ordered was 64gb it listed it on the card but this was tested and at most was 1gb and very oldi would steer far away from sandisk sold online unless it is in original packagingI returned it for a full refund and reordered and oem 64gb card from samsung fast delivery, good speeds, and good price make this a good micro sd to buy. got pretty nice speed considering im using a kinda crappy mobo and older usb slots. I held off on rating this item until I had a chance to evaluate its performance. I am glad I made the purchase. This memory card is just what I needed. It has given me a steady, and strong performance. The access time to games and photos is very acceptable. As to the unspoken problems with the Galaxy s4,I have not had a problem at this point. My card has not dismounted, nor have I experienced any failure on the memory cards part. Great card. It has worked very well for me with my GoPro. Great quality and speed. The size is perfect for heavier photographers. It\\'s a memory card.  It works as expected.  I got a full 32GB of data on this card.  Two more words. I use it for HD video recording, It work very well, no frame lost since I use this card. I have no measured the actual transfer rate, but it looks to be very fast when reading the movies from the SD, and I have no frame lost since I use this card. This is the best in its kind... works really fast. beside I like the color of this micro sd card An SD card is an SD card. Unless its broken and I have had no problems. Keep up the good work. I bought it to use in mySony HDR-AS15 Action Video Camera (Black). It works great. The camera worked just fine with a class 4 card, but the offload speed was horrible. This speedy little card has eliminated that problem. Came with a SDHC adapter, which was a nice and unexpected bonus. It says on the Acer that the max is 32GB but I popped this puppy in and it read the 64 gigs just fine.  I have my MP3s and some photos on here so I do not clog up the HD for my tablet. Great storage for the price (&#60; $1 per GB). The only draw-back is that they are rather slow to write to. I experienced absolutely no problems with this memory chip.  It came in undamaged, it connected to my phone immediately and worked flawlessly.  I would highly recommend this chip! Not much to say about the excellence of SanDisk products. Fits well, adapter very easy to use. I never been disappointed in SanDisk. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for this card.Seriously, you spend all that money on a nice phone and it\\'s like you\\'re only using it at 1/4 or 1/3 of it\\'s capability.Get this memory card and enjoy your phone how it\\'s supposed to be run. Needed more storage space for photos and videos on my phone and this fit the bill, nice and fast and now I have 40 gig free on my phone. This came with the adapter to allow the card to be used as a micro card or a standard card.  It is great and because it is class 10 it is also fast! the only reason not to buy this one is to buy the bigger one. Ive had in my phones for over 2 years and is awesome. Never worry about running out of storage. Great product! There were no issues with this card and my Galaxy S4. 29.71 GB usable space (as was expected). Price was right too. I purchased the SanDisk Ultra 64GB MicoSDXC memory card to put in my Samsung S4. I tried to purchase this memory card locally (AT&T; and BestBuy) but no one had a 64 GB memory card. I am glad that I purchased the memory card as not I can put my backups, music, podcasts, etc... on added storage. I would recommend this memory card for anyone who has a Samsung S4.PCEddie[...] I had bought the 32GB card here on sale.  It ran great for the first 4 months.  This afternoon it unmounted from my Samsung SGS III.  I powered the phone down, re-seated the card, powered up and it was still not recognized. Powered back down, pulled the card and popped it into the computer and it showed a single partition of 0 bytes. Mounted the card back into the phone and booted into recovery (my phone is rooted with CWM), where I double checked that it could not be mounted or formatted. I then tried to re-partition the card but no luck. Phone is back up and running fine on a spare 8GB card so no problems there.  It doesn\\'t matter how good or how fast the card is if it dies this quickly. I had most of my stuff backed up so no major loss, but I am out the cost of the card... Screaming deal on this retail-packaged 32gb microsd. I have not benchmarked it, but it is lightyears faster than my original 2gb card. Retail packaging (though I don\\'t like extra packaging) makes me more secure that this is not a fake. I have this installed in my Samsung tablet that has 16gb.  All my music, lots of pictures and a number of apps are on it and work flawlessly.  Can\\'t find anything wrong with it and the price was not bad either.  Love it!! Perfect in every sense.  I use it mainly for accessing my music and since I upgraded to this MicroSDHC I have found my Samsung Galaxy S3 has no lag in playback and document storage retrieval is quick Nothing bad to say, great product, great price. Works excellently in my video camera. One won\\'t go wrong with this card. I can not say it is a bad MicroSD Card, but mine Stopped working after a few months of normal use.Every time I put it into my PC or Smartphone a message came up saying that I needed to format it, But when I click on format, it showed another message saying that it was unable to format it..... The one I purchased to replace it is a POLAROID which by the way is working better than I expected.While it lasted it was perfect. Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works perfectly.  Price was better than anything I could find in the stores locally. Awesome SD card, awesome price, awesome speed, awesome quality, I really like this micro-sd card and hope it never fails. great price great for cellphones, tablets, etc. easy to put in and easy to use. it comes with a adapter too. Works perfectly and has enough storage for many hours of recording.Could be the best one out there for the price.Recommend this one. Using this in a Samsung Note II phone and I get reads of 18M/sec and writes of 9M/sec. very pleased with the performance. I use this card in my Samsung Galaxy S3 and have not had any issues with it at all. I have had other brand memory cards which have failed and become unreadable in the past, this however has accepted anything I throw at it. I use it to store all pictures that I take on the phone (currently 1,700+), music and videos. I have mp3\\'s and a few movies on it and there is never any lag or random un-mounts. I highly recommend it. just wanted extra space on my tablet and this sd works just fine for what the job i needed it for So I bought another sandisk product, and guess what? It works. Great job guys. And not too pricey either. Can\\'t wait for the 128GB version... The SD to microSD card adapter that comes with this product is too small. It is impossible to remove the card from the adapter without damaging it. Thank God for amazon return policy or I would be incensed.  This little platic device from hell died unexpectedly after 37 days.  I lost all my phone pictures that were not stored on the phone.  I lost the music but have most on PC.  I lost the videos I had from concerts.What happened was the phone gave me a warning that the storage device (Sandisk Ultra) could not be found.  I took it out and restarted my Galaxy Note 2 and it worked.  then about one hour later I got the same warning.  I tried to save my data with MY Backup Pro App (I had to purchase an extra 3 GBs of data for cloud because the App comes with only 75 MB or something like that and so I backed up everything on the Sandisk Storage).  And as it was backing everything on line  using the Backup Pro Cloud, the Sandisk fried and stopped the backup process.  I was prompted to format the storage disc but everytime I performed this process, the phone would not complete the format.  Now keep in mind that I was not near a computer because I was on vacation so I could not use a computer to format in Fat32.I am returning this disc and purchasing a Samsung 32 GB that costs over 50 bucks.  You get what you pay for. Yeah baby. Love getting this amount of memory for so cheap. I\\'m not a pro but for everyday use it\\'s a great deal. I have an s3 which are notorious apparently for killing sd cards. Last black friday I bought two normal (the black ones) 32 gb cards and my phone killed both. Sprint swore it was the cards but I defended Sandisk saying how would they sell me two defective cards in a row (~$16 each). I made a deal with Sprint saying if I bought a new card and the phone killed that one they would have to replace my phone and cards at no cost to me, so I bought this one and so far no problems so shame on you Sandisk. 5 stars for product, 0 stars for their greed. I love it so far it works as it should the price was good and I am very pleased in fact I bought a 64 gb as well for my phone I bought the 32 gb for my wife Works great with my smart phone. Didn\\'t need to format the card or anything. Just popped the card in and everything worked great out of the box. Transfer speeds are excellent with this card. I would recommend this card to everyone. This was a very good buy for me and it helps me to store more information.  It also allow me to organize my pictures and music as well. Great chip, bought it for use in my raspberry pi projects as linux hard drive.Very fast.Real deal.Price was excellent.Nice to get real chip, instead of cheap nock off, often sold as brand name card. I put this NEW sd card in my NEW GS4 for the first time, and now the metal contacts are scratched and it randomly unmounts from the phone!  My older 32GB SanDisk works just fine, so I\\'m thinking its the thicker paint or something causing this...  I don\\'t know, but its ruined!  It scratched the first day, but I\\'m just now noticing the unmounts now that I have my music on it, every few songs it will unmount and remount, interupting my music...  I\\'ll never buy another expensive SanDisk.  I\\'m going to order a different brand, just make sure I can find one without paint on it....  Sucks, I really thought this was going to be a good one!  I love the colors, and its so fast to transfer files to.... too bad its broken.  And I didn\\'t find out about it until after the return date, so i\\'m screwed.  Oh well.  Never again, I\\'ll give my business to someone else.... Easy upgrade to the storage in the LG Marquee. Seems pretty fast and stores data just fine. Not sure what else to say about memory? It works! If you want tons of capacity, here it is.  Bought mine on a pretty good sale, works perfectly, as I\\'d expected from SanDisk. So far this item is great. Purchased one for myself and then one for my niece for her phone for XMAS. Another plus the shipping was great. Got this to use with my GoPro Hero 3 black edition. Put it in, seemed to work. tried to get the data from the card after using it for a second and the card says it needs to be formatted.Looked to gopro\\'s website and it is NOT on their recommended card list. Reason being is that the card isn\\'t fast enough. It\\'s a class ten yes but clearly not fast enough.Definitely get the recommended card, IF it does work at first it will probably die in a couple of days. Using this in my Samsung Galaxy S3 and I haven\\'t had any issues with it, and it is super fast. I used it for something like 10 months in my Galaxy S III (GT-I9305) with original firmware, mainly for pictures and flac files.Suddenly I perceived that the last pictures I took disappeared; I took some more pictures as I thought that were software problems but same problem until I realized that the card was not working. Now I can\\'t write it anymore or delete information, format it, delete partition, etc. Now is a ROM. The bright side is that I did not lose valuable information like pictures that now are permanently stored in the card. I got it from amazon for an amazing price of $17.99I bought one 64, and in total 3 32GB cardsThey work great on my gopro Hero 3 - and they are the main recommended one there.with the adapter I also can use them on my Nikon D800E and I am getting 19 Pictures in Burst mode until the camera slows down when I am shooting in raw full speed - after that it takes about a minute till i can do it again - but we are talking about 900MB pictures to save.... or what do I need USB sticks? - this is smaller and faster! I purchased this SanDisk Ultra 64GB MicroSDXC Class 10/UHS-1 Memory Card With Adapter for use in my Samsung Galaxy Note I 717 under Android 4.1.2. Apparently, my phone had no problem with recognition of this large SD card. This makes it possible for me to save a lot of photos and videos. I had some feeling it&#8217;s even possible for me to get the 128 GB version to work as well on this phone. To make sure that it is fully compatible, I did a reformat using the phone of the SD card. The phone was able to detect and utilize the full capacity with no problem.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product. I will be brief and simple.Errors, errors, errors!What happened to SanDisk?  You need to check your QC unit!Awful product ever from a reputable memory company.Update: I got thisSamsung 32GB 32G Class 10 MicroSD C10 MicroSDHC Flash Memory Card Model MB-MSBGA/KRto replace the sandisk garbage. Replacement works as it should. Same on you SanDisk, you lost one of your long time customer. It is a good buy; it works great with my sports camera. It was well priced and I recommend it to all users of sport cameras. perfect i needed a class 10 micro SD card, and this small size, large memory. works just fine.  The price was very good as well The read/write speeds are fantastic. Works great in my Galaxy Note 2. I absolutely love the space, it was worth every single penny. I wasn\\'t expecting great transfer times like I get with nice compact flash cards, but this card is closer to those than the last generation of SD.  Wow. This is the largest capacity micro SDHD card that will work in theASUS MeMo Pad Smart ME301T-A1-BL 10.1-Inch 16 GB Tablet (Blue). The card itself works great, but the adapter is defective. If I didn\\'t already have another adapter, I would have to return this item. As a heavy music listener, the SanDisk Ultra has been my most reliable storage of music files that feeds my mp3 players.  STILL VERY RELIABLE AS EVER! This is a great little memory device. I now have several and they work without problem with my newer Android tablets. (Older versions before Jelly Bean have problems accessing all 64mB - jelly bean works great.) I have a Samsung Note 8 tablet and by adding this 64 GB SD card it saved me quite a bit as I did not have to move to 32 GB internal disk - - Simply just slipped the 64 GB into SD slot and off we go. I\\'ve been using it for just over a week and so far I\\'ve had no issues...not that I was expecting any as I\\'ve used  SanDisk MicroSDHC cards before which have worked reliably. These have all been of  varying sizes under 32 GB, this being the largest  size I\\'ve ever used.  I\\'ve read complaints elsewhere from persons who\\'ve had problems with the said brand  which, fortunately, have been few. This product is perfect for what I needed it for. Providing a ton of memory in my Samsung Note 10.1 in a small package. I use it for my GoPro Hero 3 Silver Edition and it works perfectly, even with Protune! If you have a GoPro, this is probably a great SD card to start with. Do not buy this if speed is an issue. You want type 4 at least for speed, but this type 1 works great in my phone to just increase storage. I keep all my pictures on it and random files. I have not used it for music but imagine that since it plays my videos included with my pictures that it could easily handle music. Best, most reliable microSD card you can get. I use it for all my devices; phones, tablets, cameras, camcorders, GoPro cameras... Does what it is supposed to do.  What more can you say?  I have no reason to rate it lower than 5 stars for that purpose. What can I say, it does what it\\'s supposed to do. What I really like is the price, much much cheaper than what you pay at the best buy or radio shack.  Plus I got the card in less than 2 days without paying extra for 2nd day or overnight shipping. Best memory I have found for consistency and high speed. Ideal for any modern application, especially high definition video recording. THE PRICE IS REASONABLE, QUICK 2 DAY DELIVERY WITH AMAZON PRIME, I HAD TO RETURN A 32 GB DRIVE BECAUSE OF MALFUNCTION, AMAZON TOOK CARE OF ME RIGHT AWAY, CREDITED THE OLD SD CARD AND SO FAR THIS ONE IS WORKING AS EXPECTED, BE SURE TO FORMAT THIS SD CARD TO YOUR DEVICE BEFORE USING SO IT RECOGNIZES YOUR DEVICE THAT YOU ARE USING IT IN. There is a known issue with a batch of these cards where they can completely die.  This is known defect (affecting a lot of Galaxy S3 and Note users), so if your card dies, either exchange through Amazon or contact SanDisk for a replacement.  Newer cards are supposedly fixed, but you might want to back up your data just in case.  Mine were purchased in November 2012 and both have now failed in separate phones, unreadable by PCs or phones. Stick this in the slot and forget about it.  Not sure what is being stored on this little thing or when I should remove it from my phone but, hey, it\\'s in there. I installed this on my Galaxy Note 2 and it crashed after one month. Lost all my pictures on the card. Had it not been for Google Plus instant upload and redundant backup to Dropbox all of the pictures would have been lost. I think I should get a refund but I did not keep the original packaging. I would not buy this, but if you do keep the packaging so you can return it. If you read most of the reviews you will see that a lot of people have had trouble with this card crashing. I don\\'t think Amazon should offer it as it hurts their overall customer satisfaction. Well i do try to take alot of pictures and with this card it does the job for me, i would recommend this to even my enemies really good product especially when they go on sale on amazon....Package kinda two big for this little thing, but i will work with that little problem. I brought this for my new phone, the note 3. For me when it comes to any kinds of cards for camera, phones or any device that uses cards I trust SanDisk. I have them in my DSLR, my Go Pro Camera. I\\'m a professional photographer and I have never had a problem with scan disk cards. So whenever I\\'m in need of a SD Card, Or Micro SDXC this is the brand I go with. What can I say? It\\'s the best price I could find for a 64 GB micro SD, and it works great in my Samsung Note 3. When I finally decide to buy a Note 10.4 or Note Pro 12.2, this 64GB card will be ordered right along with it. I purchased this as a gift for my daughter because she takes a lot of photos stored on her cell and bogs it down. It will be a while now before she needs to clean house again, LOL! Would also be good for those that need to store everything, you know who you are, now get one...R/KMW Inexpensive, fast and made my videos a bit less choppy during recording HD.  A good buy now, and seems to be a better value for the Class 10 cards... Bought this for use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. Works great! No formatting, no muss, just works like it should. The ScanDisk 63 GB  SDXC card is a geat value and I get HOURS of recording HD video with wonderful results. I prefer ScanDisk because they are reliable.  Setting up a video shoot with a client, spending hours recording and then calling my client to explain that I bought a cheap, unreliable card that failed... and NOW I have to reschedule a re-shootand the project will have a late delivery...  JUST ISN\\'T SMART.  I must have reliability and ScanDisk delivers! After exactly month and a half this card is done...and with it i lost all my pics and videos...just after the return policy expired!! card is not recognized by my phone or PC. Trying to get RMA from Sandisk...I own the S3 and have read extensive problems with the 32 and 64gb card class 10! Samsung says is Sandisk...and Sandisk says is the phone ??? But i\\'ve seen other cards failing with different phones! All Android by the way...What\\'s the problem ? great card, haven\\'t had one crash yet.  for $20 you can\\'t go wrong with the 32 gb sandisk memory card. This card is very responsive and never encountered a single issue. Works great in very cold or hot weather! I am using it when skiing and it is often exposed to very cold weather. I have stored so far few hundred hours of video over multiple events and not a glitch. Would buy again for sure. I am not a technical person who can give all the specs on this but I put it in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and it works fine. this does excatly what i bought it for goes in to my phone and is a nice storage comes with a micro sd to sd converter so it was a nice buy Works fine, although videos seem to jerk a little in spots. I don\\'t know if it\\'s the phone or the card. But anyway, the capacity is huge, and music plays great and photos look fine. No issues. Upon receiving, I installed in my Samsung galaxy S4 phone.  It works great and gives me the maximum memory available for this phone model. No complaints, fast ship, fair price. I don\\'t know what else that I can add to other 5 star reviews except to say that this installed flawlessly in my Nook HD+. Works perfect in my HTC One V. No complaints. Love the amount of space in the tiny package. Fast as you need for a phone! It was a Good value for money , Product was delivered on time and in good condition. I am using it with my tablet and am happy with the performance. I would give these a 5th star if the memory  had consistent read/write times per card.I\\'m not saying they aren\\'t fast,  but they all should stay within the rated speed they\\'ve been tested for, especially when in a USB 3.0 card  reader! After they have been used several times their speed decreases to below the threshold,  of the Standard set for these chips. Can\\'t go wrong with SanDisk memory. Have bought these for phones, gaming and a GoPro.  Good capacity, convenient and durable. What can you say its sandisk AWESOME ! Installed on my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 music and movies!!!! HD digital copy !!! Bought this to use in my Samsung SIII as it was supposed to be a fast card. Worked fine until it totally died after less than a year of very little us due to the design of the SIII. Phone popped up a message that the SD card had been removed (it hadn\\'t). Nothing I did to the phone brought the card back up. Removed it and tried it in my laptop (Win7) and other computer (XP Pro) and it is totally dead, neither will even recognize its in the drive. Working with Sandisk to get a replacement, they want all kinds of fairly useless information, will see if I get an RMA number and replacement card.This is the first memory card I have ever had fail.As an update, warranty service from Sandisk has proven to be non-existent. They first asked to have over 16 questions answered, then mysteriously lost all the answers I sent back, three times. Works just as it should in my Lumia 810; no issues at all. The phone is not a particularly speed sensitive application for the card so I cannot comment on how well it works under stress. The phone doesn\\'t complain, music plays nicely from the card, pictures are written to it without delays. The red and gray design looks different and interesting, even though no one will see it. Super fast, keeps up with my camera speed.  I have purchased 3 total and love every single one.  Wouldn\\'t buy any other card. It\\'s a great product and I am using in my samsung galaxy S4 mobile. GS4 uses for camera store, and the pictures taken are fast. I use this in a 8 MP Android phone, the speed of the card has significantly improved picture taking speeds. I have this in a Samsung GN 10.1 2014 Edition Tablet and getting 28Mbps transfer from my Canon T3i using a Eye Fi Mobi 8GB SD Card. Got this in as described. So far it\\'s working very well. I am not a technical person on calculating the speed. For a normal person, it\\'s pretty fast and easy to access. Great product. My wife\\'s Razr M has been a great phone to date. I matched it with what I thought would be a great memory card, having been a long time Sandisk Ultra user in my photography.Sadly after 3 months, without warning, the card mysteriously \"bricked\". Unreadable by her phone, two PCs and one Mac .. the only thing that can even SEE the card is my Droid Bionic - which says the card is unreadable and needs to be formatted. I am hesitant in the very odd chance I can still recover the many gigs of photos and videos of our 6 month old baby which were not backed up.I could not be any more disappointed in this product. Not much to say other than they are made with Excellent quality. Price is fine for the qualityYes I would recommend to a friend. Good quality SD memory. The speed suggested is true for the Read speed. The write speed is slower, around 15MB/s. Seems to be authentic.  Great speed, correct capacity, and works flawlessly with my samsung phone and card readers.  Would buy again if needed for another device. Bought this for my Surface RT and it works just fine.  Also got it for $32, which was even better. The card was put into my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.0 7 and worked great right from the start.  I haven\\'t had any issues with it whatsoever. The only problem was in getting it to format to fat32 so that I could use it in myexcellent Sansa Clip+. I actually had to do a low level format and then reformat itto fat32 with  third party programs. It comes natively formatted to ex fat which many devices don\\'t read (windows only formats fat32 to 32GB ). It\\'s easy to format it to NTFS but either buy nothing bigger than 32GB or search the internet for programs and methods to reformat it if you need fat32 and you have the skill and time.Otherwise its good stuff but Scan-disk should provide a reformat program on their website imho? This worked in a Sansa clip zip when another generic brand didn\\'t.  No complaints other than a couple CBS higher price. 64 gb of fast microSD storage at a great price.  What\\'s not to love?  Works perfectly with my 64gb Dell Venue Pro 8. Back 4 years ago, you\\'d be crazy to buy this thing, because it was so expensive. 10 years ago, you\\'d practically had to make 6 figure to buy this, really, for show, because nothing can utilize it that well.Today, it\\'s cheap, it\\'s stable, and it works.Plus, it came with the adopter. Good deal. I have always trusted SanDisk.  This card works great in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 2.  I have been using it for about a month. I worked on one of the first Drum Drives. THis is still pretty darn amazing. I think if they go smaller we will lose them. grat item. good access speeds I bought the 64GB version for my Samsung Galaxy Note II and it works great.  Didn\\'t need to format or anything.  Opened the box, popped it into my phone and it worked just as expected.  Transfer speeds via usb connected to the phone and direct via card reader are both fast.I also bought the 32GB version to use (with included SD adapter) in my Canon SD4500IS.  Again, just popped it directly into my device and it was ready to go.  Very happy with both products.  I\\'ve used many Sandisk flash cards in the past without issue so I expect these will hold up extremely well over time as well.  It might be a few more bucks than some lesser known brands, but I feel its worth the premium. maybe the speed is not fast to beat others, but sandisk is always reliable. I have several sandisk SD/TF card, and they are never damaged. the data security is always very important. If you have one of the latest smartphones, go for this. I highly recommend this to take full advantage of the processing speed and fast computation need of our gadgets. Sandisk products are known for their quality and reliability. Of the couple of name brand flash products I use Sandisk gave me good ROI. Anything below will rob you of reliability. Bought this for use in my dash camera upgrade.Working very well and faster than the 4 GB card that came with the camera.  Also will work in my other digital cameras. not sure if it\\'s the card or computer but it only shows up as 32 gig. i tried reformating it and everything and it still says 32gigs. I have a point and shoot camera.  This works well with it. Have no problems so far.  I think my camera is the speed limiting step rather than this card. Sorry to say but I have to pull down rating from 5 to 2. The card went bad in just couple of months. No option to return as its beyond policy.The card came on time, good packaging and works so what else to add for this 16 GB SD card. I have a large music collection that I like to play from the phone. This allows me to put a lot more on the phone than I have in the past. I had no compatibility problems with it. Plugged it in and it worked. Can\\'t get better than that. As far as speed goes, it\\'s as fast as any card I\\'ve had in the phone. I have noticed no lag or other issues reading or writing to it in the phone. I don\\'t use it outside of the phone so I can\\'t comment on direct read/write speeds. my phone is still on gingerbread os, so this card is much faster than i will ever need with its capabilities. i like that it has a lifetime warranty, as my previous 32gb card did not have a warranty and is now fried after one year. for $28 with shipping this should hold me over for many years to come and has the speeds to keep up with future devices. overall very pleased. got 9mb/s write speed and 22mb/s read speed on a motorola defy xt using a speed test app This has some really fast speeds and has a good amount of storage. It\\'s also almost as cheap as those bargain bin items that give out after a month or so of hard usage. This one didn\\'t though. I\\'m pretty hard on flash, doing long sequential writes and what have you, and this guy just won\\'t give up. I just bought a 1080 P dash cam and I needed the best and fastest memory to get the best quality pictures. I did my homework and as I thought ScanDisk Ultra came out far above everything else out there.If you want the best and fastest memory with the highest quality on the market then get ScanDisk Ultra ! I use mine for my GoPro Black Edition and its working well with it. No freezes, records/writes up to advertised speed.And more importantly, its the BEST value for a 64GB Class 10 Micro SD A cheaper alternative than buying a tablet with more storage. Shipped promptly and the price was reasonable..I will probably purchase another. Some people complain about SD cards:1) Not working fast enough2) Some android devices are acting slow3) Rooted phones do not boot from SD cards.This card is fast about 28 MB/s, removed all the lag from Android device. HDR video recorder have no delays between video recordings (Which usually happens with most of the cards on the market) and all android rooted phones I tried booted and worked.I really recommend this card for price and performance!Good luck and enjoy you purchase. For the first two months, the card worked great in my GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition.  Then, one night, it randomly stopped working.  Amazon won\\'t take it back, and I\\'ve got an email into SanDisk to see if I can get it replaced.  Now I\\'m out $52 and now can\\'t use my camera.  Thanks so little. Hard to believe that 10 years ago you would have needed a big hard drive to have this much room. I use this card in my Samsung Y Duos Smartphone and it provides more than enough room for my entire music library, a bunch of movies, and all of the apps for my phone and I still have more than 3/4 of the space left.Works perfectly and I\\'ve always had good luck with SanDisk products. I put this in my Asus TF700T tablet. There were mixed reports of whether the tablet would support such a large card, as the official limit for this tablet is listed as 32 GB. I have had no problems with this in the TF700T, and leave it in the device all the time. This is a great way to ensure that you have a hefty amount of media available anywhere. I have used this in a number of devices, including mobile phones. When recording HD video straight to the card, I have not encountered the skips, lags or stutters that I have sometimes seen with other cards. So it certainly must be fast enough for this purpose. I bought a generic SD card for my Galaxy S5 and it corrupted all of my music. I am glad I have this SanDisk because it is faster at reading/writing and comes with the MemoryZone Backup app free, however, you need to have Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, or a similar cloud service. MemoryZone is great at backing up but lost some of my data when doing a transfer (phone to SD) :/ And you wouldn\\'t believe what Sandisk put me through to get a warranty replacement.  However I finally got the replacement and it has been working fine ever since. I purchased this to use with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1. I chose this memory card because I have used SanDisk products many time in the past and have never had a problem. Great MicroSD card at a great price, with speed. I can fit about 2-3 days worth of moderate shooting (60 fps at 1080p) on a ski trip with my GroPro on one of these cards. The cards have had no reliability issues at their required tasks  so I did not put them under any data transfer time observations Transfer speeds are good, worth the price tag, use it in my samsung galaxy s3, sometimes it craps out and has to be reformatted or rebooted in phone. Otherwise no problems Card is fast and reliable in my Galaxy Note 2 cell phone.  Copied my whole music collection to it.  No problems. it works, so far, waiting for the heat and cold to see how well it will hold up. I picked up this storage device to use in my phone. I only had a 1 gig mini sd in there for music ad it was getting pretty full. Now 30 plus gigs of free space later i can download to my hearts content. you cant beat the price and it works great . I have no problems with the card I use it for my gopro it works great Great product and price from SanDisc.  I will be using it for my cell phone, replacing the 8GB.  For my video now I have 2+ hours with the 32GB (compared to 20 minutes w/8GB) in &#34;super fine&#34; mode.  All the rest of my SanDisc memory card from years ago are still working 100%!  Thanks SanDisc!!! I bought this on black friday last year and took a chance on it. What chance u say? I read some reviews that this card just actually STOPPED working for no reason and not due to abuse or misuse. I had this card in my Acer Iconia A500 and it just STOPPED WORKING! Even my computer doesnt recognize it. WTF Sandisk?? This is an expensive part for this to occur. DO NOT BUY OR IF U DO, BE CAREFUL WHAT U STORE ON IT! I only had music and movies on mine so NBD. But what if u had this in your phone with valuable pictures? This card is both small and large at the same time. It\\'s micro size but high capacity are perfect and works well with my GoPrc Hero 3. Recording in 1080p is not an issue either. THe class 10 rating allows the GoPro to do its thing and the card is able to keep up with the high MB transfer rate. fast, used it on my dji phantom gopro hd black, not one hickup.i would buy again only cheaper. you get whacha pay for Good no problems works well. Love it--so far--as I Just purchased this as Iam not into buying SDcards but now I have a Nextbook tablet and this works great for adding video\\'s and music able to be put on this SD card. My fiance has had this in his tablet for almost a year now without a single issue. I feel that it\\'s one of the best quality memory cards we\\'ve ever had. Make SURE you get the retail packaging and not the &#34;frustration-free.&#34; The retail packaging only requires one quick clip of the scissors and it\\'s worth it to get one that is sealed in a package and not at risk to be damaged. This is being used in a Mobius Action Camera 1080P HD Mini Sports Cam/dash cam daily so the opportunity for failure or problems would be readily apparent.  It has really delivered as promised.  Speed and reliability are great.  The adapter works perfectly as well.  I have several other SanDisk products including SD cards, thumb drives and an SSD and all have been terrific.So far I can highly recommend the SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card. I will post again if any issues arise. great product......prompt service.......well done! What else can I say? That it is light and small? Not the fastest card on the market, but does the job. Copying files onto it is slow, but it is fast enough to play music or movies from it on your cellphone or other devices. How cool it is to be able to put ALL of my music on my phone! The little card works just fine and the price is reasonalble either it works or it doesn\\'t -- it works, it was a fair price and I am happy with it Well works just like any other SD card I don;t see ultra fast speeds or any thing. I shoved this guy into a Galaxy S4 and it works fine! 1080p 30fps or 720p 30fps or 24fps using the nokia camera app or regular app doesn\\'t work. well it does but unless you want to see stuttering every 6-7 seconds. it freezes up constantly. very glitchy because its slow. got a 9mbs write 44.9mbs read on mine. I never thought I could have a 64 GB memory like this one, this is awesome; especially when you have a tablet. I\\'m using it on a Asus TF300T and it\\'s working flawless. A piece of advise, since current tablets are not supposed to handle these, leave the format as exFAT, do not format it to FAT32 or NTFS. It\\'s a great brand, works perfectly, I use it for my android phone and now i got tons of extra storage. Fast product when place in my camera. I am very happy with this product. The product was received pretty fast.  The material was as described and much better.  I do recommend this product to anyone. I have copied and transported a large amount of data and it work, and no errors.  I will purchase more of these. Great product. Can always count on sandisk. Just make sure your device can support 64gb card. Don\\'t go cheap and fall for counterfeits. I was little hesitant to order this initially but turned out to be an excellent Product,Did a initial test on CrystalDiskMark.Enjoying it on my ASUS TF101.The shipping was quick too. This card it pretty fast. I very little between difference between the speed internal storage and the SD card.Works great. I have lot of these at work 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB. Though I haven\\'t done real speed tests on these, but these have been reliable all along. Used in music players, cameras, laptop SD Cards. These do sell at a little bit of premium because of their Class 10 tag, but I would buy these any day, if I need these for cameras/laptop extra storage. But if you are using these for music players, you are good even with Class 2 cards. This micro card works well with my Go Pro Hero3+, does what you would expect a micro SD card to do. Works as I expected with ScanDisk. Installed and formatted in my Samsung galaxy note 3 with no issues. Once in the phone, the real amount of usable space is only 59GB just for reference. Everyone should buy this product who likes to record with their dslr.. Works great with my canon dslr.. Great product.. Great to have the additional capacity for storage. And the card is fast. Working great and the price was great also! Haven\\'t had a chance to completely fill up the stick, but so far so good. I\\'ve taken my gopro with this in -10 below weather launching off jumps and occasionally take a beating. it\\'s a must to have it once u got the gopro. practical and very friendly, helps u to load as many recorded shots as possible. Purchased this card to expand the storage on my Samsung S4 and it does the trick.  Plenty of room to carry ebooks, music and store camera pictures.  Great item at a good price and I recommend this item for anyone needing more memory using a microSDHC Class 10 Memory Card. failed in my galaxy note after 8 months.lost all my pictures and videos that werent backed up.the card worked fine until suddenly wasnt being recognized on the phone or the computer.Sandisk honored the warrenty and sent a replacement and it works, but I am less confident about the product and afraid to lose data on it in later when i\\'m not prepared. Fast shipping. Good packaging. Fast speed card. Does what its supposed to do. Sandisk is a well known brand and I use many of there products. Currently using in a Lenovo yoga 10. Great purchase! with the best price on the market so far. I appreciate the fact that this product came ready to use and very well packaged. Please let me know if you have a thumb drive with built in security at a very low price. Money is tight but the product is worth the investment. Rolled the camera on the highest settings and till battery died. Card was fast and no complaints. Bought Two of these for my GoPro. was a decent price for the amount of memory.  Had no issues reading it on my old HP6910P laptop built in card reader.  No problems so far. Trusted SanDisk for years.  No issues, works great.  Does exactly what is needed.  I use SanDisk in all my camera and phone gear. What accolades can one say about an SD card that works and is an economical buy.  Put it in my GoPro camera and promptly filled it up. I\\'m using this 32 GB micro Sandisk Ultra to record 1080P video to a blackbox recorder in my car. I just popped it in and it worked. The adapter that came with it makes it easy to offload video to the macbook. It appears to keep up with 1080p video very well. I\\'ve never missed a frame of audio or video. It is constantly overwritten every 3 days with the oldest event and it has not failed yet. Been using it for a couple of months now. Seller mailed it USPS and it arrived in 3 days. I bought this to expand my 32GB Dell XPS 10 to 64GB. It fits easily into the Micro SD slot and was recognized by Windows RT upon boot up. I did reformat the card (old habit), and haven\\'t had any problems at all. I got this for my new Android tablet and it works perfectly. The MicroSD to SD adapter is great. It allows me to plug it into my computer into the regular sized SD card port to transfer files much quicker than if I were to plug the tablet into my computer over USB. Stick with the 32GB model. First one got SMOKING hot about 1 minute after use, but it seemed to function. Then I installed it in my Samsung Galaxy Note II and it got hot in the phone. After a day it just quite all together, luckily I still had my 32GB and a backup of my data. Did an RMA and got a new one, which didn\\'t get hot but died after less than a month of use. I\\'ll wait until Lexar\\'s 64GB comes down in price a bit and then try that one...but not this SanDisk one! Their 32GB seem to be ok though. I bought this to increase the music capacity of my MP3 player.  As a bonus I can use the adapter with my old 8 GB Micro in my digital camera. I work for Ready 2 Roll Pedicabs in Houston and we do a lot of promotional movies and put them on YouTube. We use this memory card for our full HD cam... So far we recorded 5 hour on full HD and still have plenty of space for more hours. It just took a few day when I received it in the mail. Doing its thing, no complaints I can use this in in a variety of devices with the included adapter. Seems to work great and seems to me to be very fast. Good value for the money. This card did an AMAZING job with holding my music on my phone. Videos played with ease and everything! Highly recommend this card to anyone. The SD card adapter also worked perfectly for me.I use this card on a Samsung Galaxy S2 (Epic 4G Touch, Sprint version). It works just fine on that phone even though the phone specs say it only holds up to 32gb. Just put the card in, go to your settings, fine SD and storage, and then scroll to this card and format the card. Once formatted, it\\'ll work just as any other SD card. this is a good, fast card, with plenty of capacity and it works great for additionals storage in a Microsoft Surface RT tablet.Hint: you can add the space to your windows libraries for a more seamless experience in the OS by creating a few empty, dummy folders on your C drive, then using the windows disk management console to map those folders to the folders on the card.Info on that here:[...] This microSD card works as advertised.  My Samsung Galaxy S3 developed a problem with the SD card that was included with the purchase of the phone.  Once I replaced it, it\\'s as good as new. Got it on sale for an incredible price.  The only way I am likely to upgrade from this is if they come out with a 128g size.  64g is not necessary for my use, but at 128 I would be able to use it without worry of running out of space /and/ put my entire mp3 catalog on it as well.Update - about 4 months after I bought this and installed it in my Galaxy S2, it started causing some trouble for my phone.  At first I did not realize it was the micro sd card causing the problem, but it would occasionally have a status message saying something like \"Unmount the SD card before removing it to avoid corrupting your data\", and eventually it didn\\'t even recognize that there was a card in there at all.  I put the old 1gb card back in and it works fine.  Put the 32gb card into the adapter, and put it into the computer\\'s card reader... Nothing.  Wouldn\\'t read it at all.I do back up my phone occasionally, maybe once a month, but lost everything; every photo and video I had taken of my new kitten since I got her because of this.  It is very surprising since Sandisk is usually quite reliable.  My wife has the same card in her phone, we got them around the same time, and hers is still working normally so far.YMMV, but always back up your data regularly (more than once a month) if you are taking a lot of pictures and video. Great so far working great, I\\'m using on my dell venue 8 pro and is working fine, no issues I download movies, pictures, music and I still have space in my sd card, my phone (galaxy s3) is a real and powerfull phone with 64 + 16 gigas.thank youraul Most of my reviews are positive.  This product failed (could not read on my device (a Galaxy S3) nor on my computer with 2 different readers) in less than 30 days.  The customer support is also unhelpful, as they would only replace the card after many questions, they would not provide a refund (I did not want a replacement of a card that failed so quickly).I would suggest buying a different card, it is not worth the hassle and lost data to save a couple of dollars with buying this one. Disk is very small and it fits into one that fits your computer. So far it has enough room to store my driving time for the day.You then can download everything into your computer for viewing. best buy wants almost a hundred dollars for this chip.it works perfectly in my samsung galaxy S111.  this is a outstanding phone.it was updated to jellybean 4.3.  it works flawlessly.i now have all the memory that i need in my phone.the sandisk warranty is outstanding.i doubt that i will ever have to use it.if you need to buy any chips,get them from amazon,they are much cheaper.best buy is getting greedy. YOU\\'LL NEED THE ADDED SPACE ONCE YOU START ENJOYING YOUR NEW GO-PRO ,SO WHY NOT GET THE BIGGER STORAGE ANYWAY Purchased these to use in Contour Roam cameras. Records quality videos and downloads fast.  Highly recommend these cards for your micro SD card devices. Really fast SD card, large storage space.  Works perfect.I use it for all my music and photos.  No problems so far.  Nothing much to say about it besides that it does everything I need it to. This seems to be a great MicroSDXC, as I would expect from SanDisk.  I have not tested read/write speed so I cannot comment on that.  I have it installed in my Lenovo ThinkPad 8 to provide extra storage, and it is doing what it is supposed to do.  Guess there is not much more you can say about an SD card.  I would expect it to work just as well in any device that is SDXC compatible. Love the speed and quality of the card. Previous card worked slow and would freeze or force eject. All my problems are solved now I want to upgrade the memory to my Samsung Note II. It is great to be able to instantly double my storage capacity. I am waiting for the 128 GB to down in price. perfect memory card for cell phone use; great amount of storage and has really good read/write speeds. would recommend to others Bought two of these to use in a pair of Galaxy S3 phones. Fit perfectly and were instantly recognized by the phones. Lots of room now for photos, etc. No problems at all thus far. I have quite a few SanDisk memory products, including their 128GB SS drive. All have been trouble-free, so I am hopeful. I don\\'t have any complaints about this Micro SD Card. I ordered it for my Sony Action Camera and its so far been doing extreamly well. 4 stars for the excellent price and performance. Seems to be as advertised. Average copying speeds are around 18-20MB/s.Only gripe is that SanDisk doesn\\'t include any extras - i.e. a plastic protective case, or bundle it with a SD Card reader. However, can understand why at this price point. The primary reason for buying this extra capacitySanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10card was to use it inSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch Model GT-P5113)and I am happy to share that you can get this to work flawlessly after some initial glitches. (Read below)Firstly you need to be aware that the Samsung Tablet Model GT-P5113 currently runs with Android OS 4.1.1 with Kernel 3.0.31-523998 and Build number JRO03C.P5113UECLK7.(Jelly Bean) My experiences shared here are with that level of Android OS your experiences may vary depending on what version of OS you are running. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC card purchased from Amazon (Retail Packaging) gets recognized just fine however when the tablet\\'s Media Device A.K.A \\'MTP\\' application attempts to talk your PC via USB cable the Tablet simply reboots! and after that the card is presented to the PC. - Really strange indeed!This baffled me for couple of hours. Firstly, I attempted to format the card (exFAT) in PC and it formatted just fine. After that I attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as \\'MTP\\' application tries to communicate with the PC. This made me investigate the issue further and I determined the root cause was the fact that SANDISK now seen to factory format the card with \\'exFAT\\' but also somehow seen to include an \\'offset\\' of 16MB at the beginning of the card which shows up as 16MB unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool.The solution is to get rid of that \\'unallocated\\' 16MB partition on the card. You could do it in PC but that might require some windows command line experience and using \\'diskpart\\' utility and what not and I do not want to confuse people here with that process. For most novice users The process should be very simple, Just insert the card on the tablet and use the \\'native\\' SD Card format tool under \\'settings\\' that Android OS 4.1.1 has and it will get rid of that 16MB partition and happily remount it. Now after this simple process the \\'MTP\\' application works just fine with PC to transfer files to the SD card without any strange reboot phenomenon.Not sure why SANDISK formats their Class 10 card in this fashion (They never did it with their class 6 cards earlier) and there\\'s gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that 16MB partition that only SANDISK can give. In the end if you reformat the card in the tablet (Which defaults to exFAT) the card is seen to work just fine.Bottomline:-----------This is an awesome 64GB capacity MicroSD card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully. The read and write speeds are adequate enough for most Audio,Video & picture file formats in a tablet. The glitch mentioned above forced me to give *Four* stars instead of *Five* stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it.Highly recommended!Cheers! I purchased this because my Samsumg Galaxy S3 was getting full of pictures. It installed easy, works great and I have had no speed issues when writing or reading from it, I\\'ve had this memory card in my S3 for the past few months without any issues. The only problem I\\'ve had with this was when I initially copied the 30GB of data from my old card to this card. I had this connected to my laptop using a MicroSD USB adapter and the copies kept failing. I figured out that the card was overheating when writing a lot of data. I was able to copy the data by pointing a small desk fan towards the card adapter during the file copy process. That being said, I don\\'t have any read/write problems due to overheating with the card installed in my phone. I\\'ve copied over a couple of gigs of movies to watch on some trips with the card installed in the phone without any failures. It may be that heat issue only occurs after pushing &#62;3GB of data at a time. The largest movie I copied to the phone was 2GB. Most of the other movies are just over a gig.The only prep work for use in my phone was the initial format when it was first installed. The card was recognized prior to the formatting but I had seen where others had read/write issues so the format was a preemptive move. I don\\'t have too much to say about an SD card, but I wanted to at least give it the 5 stars it deserves. We used it in a Galaxy S3 and it has worked flawlessly so far. I haven\\'t  run any benchmarks to confirm the speed, etc but it does not seem to hinder the phone or camera (which we now have saving photos/videos to the SD card) in any way.I will point out the The S3 camera app did notify us that burst mode shots will still write to the phone\\'s internal memory. Potentially due to the high date of data being written. That\\'s good to know if you use burst mode a lot and were hoping to use an SD card for that purpose. came quick and works well with my galaxy s4. formating was simple. its a sandisk not much that could be wrong with it. Full Disclosure: I use no other brand of SD Card other than SanDiskHaving said that, I was pleased to discover an SD Card designed for people who demand fast transfer speeds for HD video applications. I purchased this item for my tablet PC and have been pleased with its functionality. The adapter is great for accessing via computer to transfer files directly if USB is not desired. It\\'s been working for over 4 years on my GP camera.  Has not crashed nor failed me.  I\\'ve shot over a hundred hours of footage on this card.  I will buy again for sure. Performs as expected. I bought for mi Galaxy S3 to increase it storage options, when I need to transfer big files I use a usb adapter since the wifi and mtp conectios speed is far slower than directly connecting the device but that is not the cards problem. Its fast reading and writing inside the S3 and when connected to a current generation computer.Old computers will read and write at slower speeds, but is still compatible hardware wise. The exfat format can be a hassle.No problems yet hardware wise. I would have preferred an open standard as partition format instead of exfat, but that is Microsoft fault not Sandisk.Is easy to reformat with a USB sd/micro-sd adapter. Works well with my dslr. Have never been able to fill it. I guess 16gb would be enough for average use. Go for faster speeds and smaller size. Use it (with the included adapter) as a spare card for my Panasonic FZ200 Lumix camera and as a quick and easy temporary backup drive for my MacBook Pro laptop (which has a standard SD slot). Also use it to make a quick transfer of files between the laptop and an iMac. Works exactly like a full-size SD card for these purposes. Very fast and reliable data transfers. And the special price from Amazon made these cards less costly than the standard 32 GB card at the time.UPDATE: I have changed the star rating from a 5 to a 4. This micro card worked fine for about three months and then suddenly began to disappear from the laptop finder. It still shows up and works fine when mounted in the desktop iMac. But often it will not mount in the laptop. This could be a problem with the laptop and if that turns out to be the case, I will restore this to a 5-star rating. Pretty much as stated above.  Write rate holds up well from small files to large files.  Reads vary from 25-33MB/sec but holds pretty steadily via card reader (in supplied SD adapter), through Motorola Photon Q, and through the SanDisk SDDR-121-A11M adapter via USB 2.0 and on either PC I have I needed more storage for my Venue 8 Pro tablet, plugged it in and was able to store large files on it within minutes. So far so good. This was a great deal that I would purchase again if I need another just like it. My Galaxy Note 3 is great for videos, games and movies so it needs a lot of storage. This SanDisk had just the right amount of GBs and price to make this a great deal. It\\'s almost filled up already so I might buy another one soon. Don\\'t hesitate if you\\'re interested in quality storage. As the title says, it can cause your GoPro Hero 3 to stop recording mid recording if used at the highest resolutions and frame rates. Tried this in my Gopro Silver camera. So for seems to work.Put card in Adapter to transfer files and had a very hard time removing it again. Will not try the adapter again with this card. This 32GB card is fast.  Great for storing video and music and whatever you need to do without worry.  It is plenty large and the price is very reasonable. I formatted the card, saved the data from phone\\'s 4 gb card to desktop, dragged and dropped the files from 4gb to 32 gb card. Installed 32 gb card in phone. Phone works perfectly. Win win.And a great deal for the price. Advertised speedWorks right out of the box, no formatting requiredTrusted nameThis is a no-brainerSamsung has started to make their own line of sd cards and they seem to be cheaper at the moment when compared to the sandisk. I bought this chip to be used to increase the use of my smart phone and it has increased the memory.  At least for now. and good product.  I haven\\'t had any issue with the San Disk memory cards so I prefer to stay with them.  I have several electronic devices what use the micro SD and they all work great.  I would recommend this product. First off, I\\'ve always bought Sandisk for the warranty under the reasoning that a lifetime warranty means they must be a little better than the others and Sandisk\\'s lesser lines. I have 5 Class 6 SD 8GB Extreme III series cards all pushing 5 years old now with zero problems, all of which write nearly twice as fast. Not sure what the limitation is, Class 10 UHS-1, and 5 year newer tech should blow these away.  The \\'micro\\' packaging shouldn\\'t make a difference either.  I can only guess it\\'s marketing differentiation.Again this card will write at published specs but you may want to check out the Sony SR32UYA/TQMN of the same capacity, it reads and writes faster and is a similar price, though only a one year warranty. I picked it up with a Hisense 7 Pro tablet (awesome) and couldn\\'t wait, and they were on sale locally for $26. Was a pleasant surprise. Came with a SD adapter as well and some file recovery software (a link).  Not a fan of Sony web sites support or or documentation for any of their gear the last 15 years but these are commodities now I suppose and you can\\'t expect much any longer. I now kind of think if these things work 30 days, they\\'ll probably work 5-10 years until they are obsolete. FYI:The Sandisk and Sony are both made in China. I was pleasantly surprised that my card arrived ahead of schedule. That\\'s always a plus in my book. The works without a hitch. I was able to copy the files from my 16GB card to this one relatively quickly and very easily. My Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 read the card perfectly. I have no complaints about the card although I expected the write speed to be a little faster. After all is said and done I would definitely recommend this card for your tablet, smart phone, or any other device that allows for expandable memory. Decent transfer speeds out of phone..in phone sees around 10-12MB/s down to 5. This card is nothing to write home about however, as it only lasted me 7 months. Now it will not read in my phone or laptop or friend\\'s phone. So now I lost all my files....I recommend you store your vital files in the phone. The card does all it promises to do, but I have a gripe: the nail-ridge near the outer end of the card is not defined enough, which makes it rather difficult to extract the card from a reader or adapter.This is the first MicroSD card I have that has had this problem. It\\'s the wrong one because I thought I was getting the 64 GB one.  I need to know  how to return this one and I will reorder the right one. This card works perfectly in my Black Box Original Quality G1W dash camera. Got it on sale during blackfriday, awesome! great speeds, lots of storage works wonderful with Galaxy Note 3. Buy today! What can you say about a disk. It is doing the work that it was made to do. I am happy with it. This worked right out of the box for my Samsung Galaxy S3. Fast speeds, class 10. Half the price as a comparable product at a Big Box store. I may buy a second one later. I use these as backup for my images when I am out on a photo shoot.  As of to date, they have been very effective in reducing weight and storage space in my pack. This is a great disk and I have never had any problems with the product.  What can you say positive or negative about a product that does it\\'s intended purpose of storing memory.  Well made, simple to use, and never a problem to date! Its probably better than I think it is. I got this to go in a Samsung tablet which is about to get replaced with an iPad. But the SD memory card portion has not given me any fits yet. The write speed isn\\'t as high as some SD cards and this funky form factor requires an adapter most of the time, so don\\'t expect to pop this into your DSLR. Used in a tablet computer. Works great. May buy more for my digital camera. I liked the specs on this C10/UHS1. I had to replace the first one in my tablet! The first time I bought one of these for my tablet the disk became corrupted. I bought a replacement (this item,) and it seems to work just fine. item arrived faster than expected, and works great as additional memory on my cell phone. comes with adapter to use in regular SD card slots, which came in handy when transferring data from old card to new card. A+++ Took out my old card a black one from Kingston HC and replaced it with this Ultra one. When transferring files you can see the difference in speed. About 60% faster transfer rate than the Kingston. Buying two of the 32GB cards is even cheaper than buying one 64GB, too. It\\'s a really is a solid value. This works well and is speedy in both my Samsung Galaxy S3 and my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.  The included adapter works great in my PC memory card slot as well. A necessity for the GoPro I bought. This little guy holds all the info I need and makes for easy use. I\\'d recommend this little guy for anyone getting a GoPro. Plugged it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 and now I have enough memory to take as many pictures as I could ever want. No complaints. Been using it for over a month without issue. What can I say, it\\'s a memory card. I am using it my camera instead But if you want it on a sum sung, this isn\\'t the one to buy. Installed in my tablet to expand memory.  Works very well for this application.  Recognized by the tablet and my desktop computer with no problems. item as described. fits well in my galaxy tab 2. can access instantly both from my tab and from my computer when I plug my tab to laptop by usb cable. I like it! You can\\'t beat the value of this 32  Micro  m a cardbeliever that there is no such thing as a deal of a lifetime when it comes to electronics but for now this card really is a great value. I used this i my GoPro 3 Black and it worked flawlessly. Shooting at 47 FPS in HD without a hitch. This SD card does work with the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.  I was unable to format with a windows 7 machine, however utilized my macbook pro disk utility to format.  Works greats reads and writes videos and pics fast.  I have not tested saving apps yet, but will adjust the review when I get the chance. I\\'ve used many others, and this is average. Its in my son\\'s android, and I don\\'t really think the application its in right now is a the best way to determine its speed / performance.  Otherwise it does what i want it to.The adapter will come in handy later. Works as described.  I use it in my Samsung S5 and it was a plug and play.  Hope to have this phone until I am done with Cellphones they are getting to high priced.  everything was transfered from my old phone on to this and still have plenty of space left. Great speed, great capacity, great price, and fits great in my HTC Evo Design 4G Android phone. I recomend it. I bought this card to replace a lost 16 gig in my phone, (HTC G2). Seems to be working perfectly, so I will recommend to all. WAIT!!! read on...I had this card in my phone for a little over a month when it messed up. The phone stop recognizing the card, tried it in the computer and it was not recognized either. I contacted San-disk and they did send me out a replacement but I lost the few pictures I had on the original card. I could have sent the card to San-disk\\'s data recovery people and they would have charged me $275.00 if they were able to recover the data and nothing if they couldn\\'t. A bit to rich for me so I passed and unfortunately lost the photos. Bought this to use in our Go Pro White edition and it has worked well. No issues recording time lapse or 15 minutes of video at one time. this memory card is ultra fast in android phone its a bit costly but it works flawless it  reads fast so pics, videos etc loads in bout 3 seconds or less  highly recommended This chip seems to be thinner and lighter than the rest of my mini SD cards. Came with an adaptor card so it can be read by using a regular sized SD card slot. Or you can just read it while it is in the device. I ordered the regular packaging after reading the frustration-free packaging is sometimes counterfeit.  Anyway, the 32GB card I received was formatted as FAT32, and it seemed to work just fine in my new Moto G LTE phone running Android 4.4.3.  Moved apps onto the card, put some music on it.  Works great, no complaints. Even thoug it does not meet the specification speed, is a great product, it does what it was intended for. I bought this card to replace a Kingston card that my phone fried, it has been working without issues so far. works great with my GoPro camera, and had no problem using it in my computer, all the videos are recorded just fine and in good quality Easy to install, good performance, can be used in phone, photo machines, computer. Now i have extra space in my cell phone. Install on Samsung phone and it works great.  Recommend if you need more memory on the phone and install with no problems When i first got this item, I had some problems with it and for some reason, caused all my data on my android phone to get deleted forcing me to reinstall my custom ROM and use my previous SD card until amazon replaced this one. But once I got the replacement, it worked perfectly. I have no issues with it at all now and for the past several months, its able to hold all my apps and data with ease. With the high read/write speeds, I don\\'t have any lag and it just works exactly how I hoped it would. What can I say...it\\'s a memory card.  Aren\\'t they all the same?  No problems or issues with this product.  It works as described! I bought this to use with a portable radio that accepts the micro memory card.  The 581 pieces of music I put on it took up less than 4 Gig so I have used it with the adapter in a camera as well.  It  does the job I trusted this company but they only warranty their products about two months. I used the micro SD card in a Go Pro camera for approximately one (filming) hour and the third time I inserted it into the camera it showed;NO SD CARD;. After further investigation the card was determined to be bad. Amazon will not stand behind the card and I am out $50. This is a rare situation with Amazon, they are usually very helpful when a product is no good so this very well could be the SanDisc company behind the short warranty. When you pay this much money and the product doesn\\'t even last two months, it should get NO stars, but then you know I cannot do that!UPDATE~ AMAZON DID REPLACE THIS CARD AFTER I SENT IT BACK TO THEM SO I UPGRADED THIS REVIEW TO THREE STARS Still working...fast. It\\'s almost a mind-fart to think we can put this much (much more now of course) storage in such a tiny little space. Come on, I remember in the 90\\'s when a 3 Gigabyte hard disk was $300!!! That was soooo expensive even considering inflation.This card, is much, much, much faster than my first 3 GB hard drive...sad...but cool...wait....ouch, headache! This \"Ultra High Speed\" card is about half the speed of the Class 4 card I was using.  10MB/s Read and 6MB/s write is more than a little below where a device with this rating should perform.  I could believe if it was the same speed as my old card, maybe my brand new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 doesn\\'t have a UHS1 rated port, but to be half the speed of my Class 4 card, this \"UHS1\" thing clearly is penciled on by marketing monkeys and sold without any testing or quality control. I wish I knew how to rate with 0 stars. I got this initially for my cellphone, however I have moved it to a RaspberryPi, and it has been flawless, the storage is nice and the chip is fast, no issues to date. Very fast as advertised and had no problem installing in my samsung galaxy s3.Would highly recommend this product to anyone with a galaxy s3/s2 With all the high definition video we take the extra memory is great. And with the micro cards, we save on space in the little camera bag we have. I needed memory for my first smartphone and this item met the need.  It was reasonably priced, easily installed and according to my friends with smartphones will provide sufficient memory for the forseeable future.  Recommended. Put it in my Note 3 and it works. No hassles. Phone recognized it and started using it immediately. What else is there to say? I\\'m using this card in my Samsung camera and it works well capturing pictures fast even in continuous picture mode. The video capture is also unsurpassed with the 30MB/s capability. I have never been disappointed with a SanDisk card and this is no exception. Good quality! Phone does not recognize this card. Followed suggestions of other\\'s and formatted card to fat32. You have to have an exFatt reader on your PC. Also the format selections on a Windows 7 is NTFS or exFat no fat32 so I went to this site:[...] tried another site and got adware, which my Norton blocked couldn\\'t find the utility to do the exfat to fat32 conversion so I deleted all their added programs so beware of some of these sites. Cnet is trustworthy though.After I formatted the card to fat32 I put it in phone and the phone recognized the card and shows 59.xx gb. So what the h**l I formatted the card in the phone. Bad idea. After formatting in the phone, I\\'m back to the phone not recognizing the card. Back to the PC, format to fat32 and now every things hunky dory. I am not sure what happened to these cards but I have owned several and they stop working quickly.  I sent a message to SanDisk and never heard back.  Very disappointing! Works great. What more do you want. Versatile, small, and a lot of memory. I use it with multiple camera\\'s and sound recording devices. Had to return it because it only formats into certain formats and i needed ntfs which it would not do at the time.I did purchase this again in Oct 2013 and found it work as needed. So far it\\'s working great. This SanDisk class 10 microSDHC is installed in my phone and works great. As always, SanDIsk lives up to its name. This is great. It gives me a lot of extra storage space for my phone. It just worked out of the box. Perfect. Does what it is supposed to do. Performance is good and never seems to slow down the phone. Great product so far Work great with my Samsung Galaxy S4. Simple to install and redirect in settings. I don\\'t get the memory warnings anymore. I bought this memory card for my galaxy note 2 phone. I saved a lot of money by purchasing the 16gb phone and just buying this memory card. I haven\\'t came close to filling it up yet, but when i do, i\\'ll just upgrade to the 64gb version of this card. great product! fast shipping! great price! I had purchased this card for my wife\\'s phone.  She is in love with it as this helped her store all her eBooks, songs, few of her all time &#34;To Go To&#34; movies and her office docs etc. on that new card.  The card came, I formated it and installed it.  Rebooted the phone and it works... Phone was able to see new extpned storage and worked right away.  Its an awesome card - fast read and write.  Highly recommanded for anyone looking to expend their degital storage.Chers! I like this product as it works very well. At first it only showed but when I plugged my camera using this micro-sdhc into my laptop and seen that this card had 2 partitions on it, I had to chose the correct one to use, otherwise I couldn\\'t take many pictures or videos. A good memory card, no actually a great memory card!  I use it in my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  I have quite a lot of music and pictures on the card and there is no lag or delay when I\\'m going from one song to the next.  And my pictures display quickly.  I\\'m glad I got the 64gb card because even though I have a lot of media on the card, I still have space for more.  The price for the card is really nice also.  A good buy What else can you say about SanDisk...they have the products that do the job for everyone who needs solid trust! Arrived fast.  Works with all my digital devices no issues.Haven\\'t tested the speed yet but should be more than adequate for data transfer. Bought this for my Samsung Exhibit which has a small internal memory so I could move Google translate onto it. That did not work out since almost all apps wont transfer over to the memory card. But now I can take a ton of photos/videos and store music. No problem with it so far. fast quick does what it\\'s suppose to do. I have placed this card in my GPro Hero 3 Black edition. I bought a new underwater camera. So my 32 GB Adata went to the camera and this Sandisk went to my Galaxy Note 10.1.  On our family vacation I took the newly purchased camera and the 32 gb Adata.  Long story short:  A lot the photos and videos taken in Cancun are gone.  Photos and video from top of a Mayan ruin (pyramid), snorkeling, family photos are all corrupted and gone.  At first, I thought it was the camera until I placed the Sandisk in and experimented with it.  This Sandisk was flawless!  I will be staying away from lesser known brands and staying with Sandisk going forward. Not much to say, It is a memory card and does the job well. No problems at all with this card I used this to record continuously and it worked great. I have read to not try to update with a card bigger than 32gb in the camera so I always revert back to a smaller card before connecting for updates. I bought this sd card to expand the memory on my Samsung tablet.  I had read that the galaxy note could only be expanded up to 32gb as the sd card would have to be formated as fat32.Long story short,  I inserted it and without any problems or formatting it showed as 60 odd GB.Noyce! great little SD.... Does it\\'s job. Not much to say.  It\\'s SanDisk, so you know it\\'s pretty much the standard for consumer-level flash-based data storage. For the price it\\'s a very good deal. I have lots of space and it works perfect in my cell phone. I bought one for my daughter and one for my daughter-in-law: they inserted them into their phones and transferred their iTunes to their Galaxy S2 and S3 phones. use it with my GS4,,no data corrupt/loss issues encountered. Also being Class 10 it holds true to speed claims.would highly recommend. I knew I was going to purchase a New Samsung Note 2 phone and I purchased this long before I actually needed it. I\\'m very pleased I did because I finally got my New Phone, added the memory and I\\'m very pleased so far. With the Holidays near, I plan to take lots of Photos and Videos with my New Phone and the Extra Memory will be very helpful. Not a whole lot to report other than the card has been working great so far in my S4.  No problems whatsoever. Use these in every smartphone I have and have never had any issues with them.  I would recommend these to anyone that needs good expansion in their phone. This card is being used in my blackberry z10 and keeps my documents, photos, music working fine. This is a good buy. I bought this card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  It is exactly what I wanted and it works great. These cards have worked flawlessly in cameras mounted on an offroad race car.  They capture HD video without stutter. I highly recommend them for this purpose. I got this to increase the storage in my MS Surface RT.  It has worked like a charm and I\\'ve never had any problem with it. I like my device to have enough storage so I finally purchased the 64GB version. Formatted the card and haven\\'t fun into any kind of problem. Inserted it into my Samsun Galaxy 8 tablet, now it\\'s complete. There are a lot of other reviews on this memory card. My only addition is that it worked perfectly the moment I put it into my S4; no formatting issues, nothing ... it just worked. Also nice that it comes with an SD adapter. It works just like it should. It really does work like it should. I bought this thinking it would work and it does! decent size card, that performs well with my hero 3.  shot video at 720p had no issues.  not much more to say than it works. I put this in a Sprint Galaxy S3. Mounted it and used it. Still using it. More storage than I will ever need. I purchased this for my Motorola Xoom and it works great. I also use it with my Cannon T2i camera and it is the only card that doesn\\'t lock up or give me a busy while videoing HD. I am very happy with it I used mine to download MP3\\'s on my phone in order to not run up streaming charges and it\\'s excellent for the purpose, or for any other extra storage needs.  It fits my Galaxy S4 perfectly, was very easy to install, and seems to be working seamlessly.  I highly recommend it. It works great, good size good  and good price. Only giving it 4 stars because it is a &#34;little&#34; slow to write and read from but it is to be expected from an XC card with speeds up to 10mb/s I believe. This is a great card that does what it\\'s supposed to do. I will definitely buy again when the need arises. Works well and is exactly as advertised.  I haven\\'t had any issues with the product.  I am enjoying the extra capacity it offers in my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. I have this in my wife\\'s Nokia Lumia 521 and it works really well. The card seems to stream data well and the phone has never behaved oddly with this card I bought this for my GoPro Hero 3 and it performed perfect! 15 minutes of video equaled about 3GB of memory. Item works, great price, what more can you ask for!?!?! Once again Amazon saves me both money and time. WIN Replaced 16 gig in my android phone, motorolla atrix 2.  Works great.  No issues.  Been going strong for months now. If you have a gopro, get a different card, it worked in mine for a while then stopped, turns out the gopro fried it, no fault of gopro but through sandisks error, sandisk will replace it but it can get fried again. I\\'ve read up on it and it\\'s a common issue, so if you use this for a gopro, get a samsung or patriot or something else to be on the safe side. I have two of these that I use in my Asus Infinty tablet.I have one in an SD adapter in the dock and the other in a MicroUSB adapter in the dock. I recently purchased a new SanDisk 64GB micro SD card and I\\'m very happy with the read/write speeds. I do a lot of videoing of my grandkids and this card does exactly as advertised.  Never any lag time or missed frames with this card, and with an adapter I can use it all my devices. there are lots of cards out there. what me choose this one, was the name brand and that it is a class 10, the best you can get. not a four , a ten. The storage works for my phone but when you install the storage into the SD adapter, my computer doesn\\'t read the data. I wanted a micro SD card for a camera I purchased and this fit the bill at a reasonable price.Fit right in and works well Perfect Just what I wanted! I get all my Micro SD cards from Amazon because SanDisk are the best and the best price is here. Have only transfered some pictures and music so far. My S3  Galazy had no problems recognizing the card...hear a lot of rumors about memory cards not working, having to format first, etc., but this one worked from me right out of the box.The included Adapter is also good when I want to use with my computer(s) for slide shows since MicroSDHC are not supported by many if any..just to small. This is a SanDisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSDHC Class 10, that means that it is a fast card.  You cannot beat the price, unless you buy a slower card.  Great quality, great name, & outstanding price.  Cannot go wrong with this card.  Costco sells two of them in a pack for approx. $25.00.  No shipping charges thru Amazon.  Arrived very quickly. I am very happy with this card. I\\'ve never used a micro SD and am very pleased with this. I normally buy SanDisk, but purchased a Dane for my daughter\\'s camera for Christmas. It lasted about 3 minutes. This was a very good replacement. Have in a USB 3.0 slot on my Iconia W700 docking station. Does what it is supposed to do. What more can you expect? I purchased this to go into an external wireless connect drive that is made by the same manufacturer. Other than having to format it differently than the default (a very simple process), I have not experienced any issues with it. Comes with the SD card converter, good size for camera memory it reduces your need to change it so often. Great card. 2 years and 3 phones later and its still ticking. Excellent read/write speeds. Does very well in my Note 2 and Note 3. I did a directory swap on my note 2 so that I could use this 64gb as the &#34;phones memory&#34; while the 16gb in the phone was the &#34;external SD&#34;. Honestly, it was stupid the stopped letting apps be put on the sdcard (which they brought back in android 4.3) and I was always short on space due to the massive size of games these days. The card responded just like the phones built in memory as far as speed goes. Never saw a performance drop of any kind. Was able to play demanding games like NOVA3 or GTA3 without lag or any skipping. And the card survived 3 phones. First note 2 took a nasty plunge that totaled the phone. Card was perfectly fine. I bought this for my new Galaxy Tab and it works flawlessly, nothing to complain about. I always use sandisk products and they have never fail to me. I have one of these (16 GB) on almost every device at home, digital cameras, phones and now in a tablet. I got these on sale and must say they truly have so much space for a good price. SO anytime you see them on sale start snatchng these babies up especially if you like to travel. It is a 64MB microSD card with a sd card adapter. I used it in my Samsung 3GS cell phone without issue. I WAS LOOKING FOR A WHILE FOR ONE HAPPY I FOUND THIS THE PRICE WAS GREAT BESTBUY WANTED DOUBLE THE PRICE FOR IT ILL NEVER BUY ON BESTBUY AGAIN ONLY AMAZON I always buy SanDisk when thinking of micro memory.  This memory is fast and holds a lot!  I use it as extra storage within my hotspot. I installed this in a tablet that I am giving as a gift, and so far so good. This is the second one I purchased I installed the first one in my tablet and it seems to be working fine also. Works well - no problems.  This is a very good price for a name brand SD card.  I will buy again A sweet spot for MicroSDHC\\'s.  Added a nice bump in memory for my Nokia Lumia 822.  Arrived on time and is being used as I write this comment. Its going back because it doesn\\'t meet spec.Tested with  H2TestW, write speed is only 9.69 MB/s. Read speed is good at 18.80 MB/s. (although Sandisk claims up to 30MB/s)Meanwhile, a class (10) 32GB Transcend SD card I have writes at 15.30 and reads at 18.20.I also have a few class (6) 4GB Sandisk microSD cards writing at 15.40 and 15.50. Reading speed is 18.40 and 18.30.I also have a class (4) Kingston card that beats this class 10 Sandisk. Its a small micro memory card that comes with a full size adapter. I am using it in action cameras and have had no issues with it. It transfers data quickly between the card and my PC with no problems. I\\'m using the card in my new Samsung S4 phone. Work as it should. No Problem. This is the largest size I can use. Bought these together with the SD and couldn\\'t found any better pricing than these. Just don\\'t know where I will be using it for but it will come in handy and that\\'s lowest price I\\'ve ever seen....thanks for the great product ..... UPDATE:I raised my star rating on this from 1 to 4 because of the customer service.  I was able to get a replacement pretty easily.  Hopefully it will last longer!ORIGINAL REVIEW:This item worked well while it lasted.  I bought it in October 2012 for my tablet pc and then for an android smartphone.  I did not make many transfers to the card, it was mostly reading files from it.  Now it is March 2013 and suddenly the card is no longer recognized in my android phone.  It is no longer recognized on my other devices as well.  I lost many photos and videos on the card because of it.  I\\'m sure Sandisk will exchange it for a new one, but this shouldn\\'t be happening with a card that is less than a year old. Bought this for my Epic 4g touch, great card and great price. I store tons of pictures and music on it and still have plenty room. 32gb of micro storage. Can fit tons of songs or movies on it as well as games which is nice for your phone or tablet. Also the fact that I got it for $24 is pretty awesome too. Thanks Amazon! There is a lot of conflicting info on the we about whether cards larger than 32gb work in this phone. The phone specs say that it only supports up to 32gb. I put it in, formatted it and got 59.7 gb of usable space, which is exactly what you would expect. I have been using it for ~3 weeks now and it has worked perfectly. Good price too. I use them in my Xperia tablet Z, Note II, Macbook (with a Nifty Minidrive), and Lumia 2520.  A word to those who use custom roms on android devices, use a program that will format to fat32, it comes in ExFat that has licensing restrictions but that should work with most stock roms. Disappointed that the Acer netbook could not read the 32GB microSDHC using  included adaptor but the memory card functions perfectly in Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus Android telephone.  Moved large video files very quickly. Just as advertised this microSDHC card works perfectly with our new smart phones, allowing LOTS of apps!  Highly recommended!TRY it, you\\'ll like it! I got this for my camera to use when I know I need to shoot JPEG+RAW.  It keeps up no problem with 1080p/60 as well.  Unless I\\'m trying, I don\\'t really feel the limits of this MicroSD card. I have used it with no problem on my tablet Galaxy Note 10.1 Sansun from day one and it works perfect. The cost was relatively low compared to other stores. This was an inexpensive way to get my Galaxy Note II from 16GB to 32GB of memory. Its plenty fast and can hold lots of photos, music, etc. works great ,perfect in my GS3, popped in and ready to go.Can\\'t beat the price and quality of this card. best bargan on the market. good size for a good price so what more can you want it works and wont break as it seems 16GB and it works! The SanDisk Ultras tend to work reliably on all my different cameras and phones which is not always true of some common but less expensive cards. This simplifies ordering but they do cost a bit more. This SanDisk UHS-1 TF Card is in good quality.However, it is not working as fast as the Class 10 standard. For operating a series of 4KB files, it can only read at ~2.6MB/s and write at 1.5MB/s.Compared to the SAMSUNG UHS-1 microsd, the SAMSUNG UHS-1 card can at least process 5MB of 4KB files per second, either reading or writing. For reading/writing giant files, This Sandisk card can reach &#62;30MB/S for reading and &#62;15MB/s for writing, which is acceptable for this price, but still a bit lower than SAMSUNG. Ordered for my sons phone and was extremely happy with the card when it arrived. Would absolutely order again if needed. 32 GB seems to be the right size memory card for my needs. The micro SD card fits several of my devices and downloads easily to the computer. I bought my stepdaughter a Galaxy phone, and I didnt want to spend the extra money to upgrade her phone from 16gb. This was cheap and works fine. I mean we all know SadDisk, leaders in micro memory card manufacturing.  Usually $50 got it for $35! Unbeatable. Yes! Needed a memory card for my phone (Samsung Galaxy III) and this works fine for it.  No problems at all. The description is quite confusing - it says at same time class 10, which means that you should not expect write speed higher than 10mb/sec, and at the same time, it says UHS-1, which means 30mb/sec write speed. The truth, as usually, is somewhere in the middle, but close to lower end. I have a dedicated, high speed PCI-E cardreader, which I use for chip benchmarking. So, this card showed 12mb/sec sequental write speed and 34mb/sec sequental read speed. So, UHS-1 is \"true\" only for read operations, meaning that if you wanted this card to speed-up your digital camera speed photography - you\\'ve made the wrong choice. Just for reference, this cardTranscend 16 GB Class 10 microSDHC Flash Memory Card TS16GUSDHC10has sequental write speed of 17mb/sec and sequental read speed of 24mb/sec. As you see, the cheaper transcend has average 40% faster write speeds! Just wonderful. Perfect for my new phone. Does what it is designed to do. Fits in fine. Works very well. It\\'s a SanDisk, so what more is there to say? The quality is fantastic and it helps you transfer files if you are wary of the cloud. SanDisk is the highest quality of micro SD and this one will work in basically any Android phone or tablet made in the last 2 years, including Samsung Galaxy S3 S4 Note 2 Note 3. If you like to see videos on tablets or phones, you\\'ll end up needing this guy. And this is the fastest. Very good for recording too. Seemed to work as advertised.  But my first one failed abruptly after one week.  My smartphone failed to &#34;see&#34; it.  But Amazon replaced it at no additional charge.  The second one is still working fine.  (My smartphone is a Samsung S4G.) Have had this card for months, and used it on a Sansa Clip+, LG Optimus One (P500h), LG G (E970), Asus MeMO Pad, and of course on a whole lot of readers for PC. is very good micro sd , i use with my samsung galazy s 4 and work perfectly , have more space to my music you can film up to 2:30 hours with it, and 4000 pictures on 5MP so no bad for what i need. MICROSOFT SURFACE RT FITS PERFECTLY!!!!!!! speeeds ive seen are arounf 30MB/s wrting speeds**tipRight click documents folder, click properties and move the document folder to this microsd card ;) dont save on your computer thats only for programs ok people!!!!!!!!1 This is my first Ultra Micro SD Card.  I like the color which makes them easy to see because I swap them out all the time in my ASUS tablet.  The black ones can be hard to see on the busy desk.  The speed is great but that is not why I bought it.  I was very impressed with the price on Black Friday 2013. LOTS OF SPACE, HOLD LOTS OF MUSIC, VIDEOS, PICTURES. GOOD PRICE, HAPPY CUSTOMER.NO COMPLAINTS. WORKS WELL IN MY SAMSUNG TABLET. This card works great with my Garmin Zumo GPS unit.  I mainly use it to hold vast numbers of songs, and it works great for that.  It is fast enough that my Nuvo has no difficulty accessing the memory and I note no slowdown in performance of the GPS.  Comes with an adaptor so you can use it in a regular SD card reader.  For my needs this one is perfect, hence the five star rating.  RJB. This card is very fast and perfect for my Samsung Galaxy Note. I used it for HDR photography and it works very well. Good fast and reliable SDHC for the price can\\'t beat it! Been using this for video and photos no issues at all. Recommended by GoPro for my camera.No problems even with very high shutter speeds.Next time I will purchase the 64GB version. Had it installed on my cell phone for about 6 months now and it works flawlessly. very pleased with this product. I\\'ve been using this for a couple weeks in my Galaxy Note 2 with no problems and Gallery performance (which is primary use for extra storage) has been great. It\\'s faster than my 2 year old 32GB Micro SD cards, and this 64GB version works great with my Samsung S4 phone. I didn\\'t even need to format the card, it came pre-formatted, FAT32 I think. Love my memory card. The bigger the better for my phone. I put all kinds of music movies porn whatever on my memory card in a snap. Thank you. No problem in using it to store medium res video for my kid\\'s android device. Works as expected and as described. I WAS ABLE TO PUT ALL MY VAMPIRELLA MAGAZINES ALONG WITH SOME EERIE, CREEPY & MAD MAGAZINES PLUS SOME MOVIES LIKE THE ORIGINAL NICK FURY, THE NEW black PANTHER, THE ONE WHERE HE;S NOW A WHITE GUY. AWESOME !!! I have nothing bad to say about this product. the packaging indicated that it was new, never tampered with. it came in the mail on time and I have had no issues with the card overheating like some other reviews have mentioned. I like that fact that now I have 16GB of space and this means I can have more pictures and home movies on my phone to share. Also music for when I\\'m working out. Great buy and for the price I really like it. I recommend it and will be buying one more for another phone. lots of memory and it come with the adapter that makes it easer to connect to your computer or other devices. It is a good card and does the job well.  Now I am going to have to fill in this space as there isn\\'t much else to say about this.  Using this as expansion for Dell Venue 8 Pro.  Now have almost 64G of open capacity on the tablet. Installed one in both mine and my Wife\\'s Galaxy S IIII phones, and am a happy camper! Now we have to learn how to use them properly. A name you can trust.  Good price, now I just have to figure out how to use it in my Note. Works perfectly in my Samsung tablet! It\\'s a memory card. You take pics, the card stores them. If this is too complex a concept, ask someone for help... I am going to start spending a little more money if needed and start buying Transcend. The one Transcend thumb drive I\\'ve purchased, 64G, works great and always has. The SanDisk 64G thumb drive always had some kind of annoying problem until it finally quit working. Everything I\\'ve been told to do to reformat and reset it doesn\\'t help. And FYI, I ALWAYS ejected the drive before I disconnected it. These memory cards from SanDisk that I\\'ve bought also have these little headaches all the time. All my Transcend work great and they have been faster to copy my 40G worth of music to. Spend the little extra money if need be and buy the Transcend. This thing works great! I call this, new technology. This is the very best in micro storage, convenient, small and fast. And i hate typing a bizillion words to say that i like it. I have used this brand for a while, and no complaints...  writing HD video to them quite often no issues. Muy bueno, realmente es rapido como dice, mi galaxy s2 arranca mucho mas rapido que con la mSD que ten&iacute;a anteriormente que era clase 4 I purchased this card as memory storage for my Asus TF700 tablet and it works like a charm. Highly recommended! I find San Disk always to be a good choice for storage options. Capacity and performance are always top notch. This is a great card that works with the Galaxy S3 phone. I just put the card in and it worked. This item hasn\\'t failed me yet.  Using it in my Samsung Galaxy S4 cell phone.  I keep music and pictures on it, both seem easily accessible. no matter the product SanDisk is always a prime choice. I\\'ve ordered so many of these for all of my devices and recommend these to all my friends. For me personally, I own 5 or so:2 for phone 1 for movies and 1 for everything else1 for go pro cam1 for 24mp camera1 for game cameraall no problems Holds trillions of movie and music files on my Galaxy Note 2, therefore I love it. Good price and works as advertised.What more would one desire? Sooo quick. great deal on a great product. No problems with unmounting on my Samsung galaxy s3. Would definitely buy again. Works just fine in my Galaxy S4.  No problems.  Unbelievable how much storage you can get in such a small space and for such a low price. While I prefer the Pro SanDisk for my cameras, this has worked well in a smaller point-and-shoot camera, and now in my Galaxy SIII.  Plenty of room on it.  Ultra is not as fast as Pro, but plenty fast enough for my phone, including the few photos I take.  About 1 to 1.5 seconds to write to it.  Now getting 64 Gb units, and looking at a 128 Gb (expensive). This card is very fast as described, I had no problem transferring my data from my old 32GB card. Shipped quickly. works great have used SanDisk many times always a good product at a great price.  It comes in a nice case to protect it when not being used. gave this to my girlfriend so she can take more pics and save them ono this memo. This thing says it can transfer 30mb/s, the thinig is that it\\'s really fast, it\\'s faster than previous memos i\\'ve had. Lives up the billing of very fast data transfer speeds.  I love that I can just plug my Note 2 into my PC and drop stuff onto this thing to my hearts content.  Access speeds are very good and I\\'ve had no issues using it. If you were looking for a class 10 microsd card in order to DIRECTLY transfer files from your PC to your phone the fastest way possible you can go with a cheaper class 4 instead of this one. The speed is not much different than other class 4 microsd cards I\\'ve had. It\\'s very far from the 30mb/s they promise, I got only about 4.5mb/s AT MUCH, and after a few minutes it\\'s downhill from there. I tested on both windows and linux and didn\\'t see a difference. Luckily there\\'s not a lot of difference in price between a high quality class 4 and this one but then again, maybe I didn\\'t look at the class 4 the way I should have since I was focused on getting a class 10. Oh well, you\\'ve been warned. Don\\'t expect magic from this card.UPDATE 12/11/2013: Sandisk proactively answered this review to ask me to contact them. The reason I didn\\'t contact them first it\\'s because you usually receive slimy answers from this tech support and hardly any solution or help. It is indeed a waste of time. After sandisk comment I contacted them through one of their live chat agents and this is the interchange. My suspicious were confirmed and I indeed wasted my time:Daniel S.: Hello, thank you for contacting SanDisk. My name is Daniel S.. Please give me a moment while I look into your question.fer da: heyfer da: i just got this answer from sandisk:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EMA7XPN7IDZD/ref=cm_cd_notf_message?ie=UTF8&cdForum;=FxFNZEI17MH7ND&cdPage;=1&cdThread;=Tx7VKC9UPWNI9X#Mx3FKEEV0WIILE3Daniel S.: Please tell me what is written on the face of the memory card?fer da: never thought of contacting you because i thought i was just going to waste my time, but it was nice to be contacted proactively by youfer da: okfer da: the same thing as the one on the picturefer da: sandisk ultrafer da: microsdhc Ifer da: 32gbDaniel S.: Please allow me a moment.fer da: will you need more info from the card?Daniel S.: The Sandisk Ultra card is a UHS-I card and provides optimum performances when used with a UHS-I enabled device or card reader.fer da: my phone is off.. lolfer da: it says that it is a class 10 card, i bought it because of the promise of better speeds than the regular class 4 when using it with my phoneDaniel S.: I would like to inform you that you will get the minimum read speed of 10 mbps on a UHS-I enable device as the card is built on the UHS-I technology.fer da: and write speeds?fer da: i\\'m getting like 4mb/sfer da: a far cry from the 30 MB/s2 promisedDaniel S.: I would like to inform you that so I said the card is built on the UHS-I technology it will give the optimum speed with an UHS-I enable device.Daniel S.: You will get the minimum write speed of 10 mbps with an UHS-I enable device.fer da: okfer da: waste of time confirmedDaniel S.: I would like to inform you that if you\\'ll use this card with an UHS-I enable device it will give you the optimum speed as it\\'s promise.Daniel S.: Is there anything else I may assist you with?***removed one star because of the sliminess of contacting me via amazon to show \"sandisk cares\" but not really offering any real support when contacted. I bought this 64GB card to use for photo storage on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. The phone also recognized the card instantly. This is about the best deal for 64 gigs I have been able to find. If you have a music library (or in my case pictures library) that won\\'t fit on your phone, this card is for you! I am using this 64 GB card onSamsung Galaxy Note II N7100 Unlocked GSM International Version White. I coped over 50 GB podcasts/music. It took several hours to copy from a 3 year old laptop. After copying, the inbuild Samsung\\'s music player recognized all and playing is very smooth. The card looks super fast, no reading. After booting the phone, the music is indexed almost immediately and I can play. I have attached a screenshot which shows only 59+ GB is available. The 5 GB seems lot to be missing. I am assuming it is used for storing some index information/some restore information. storage size, fast read/write speed, great price (almost half that of a certain popular brick & mortar store).  I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and I\\'m glad I chose it.  I would def recommend it to anyone looking for microSD storage. Works great at a good price and comes with an adapter.  It has been very reliable and seems very fast I used this in a Roku 3 video streamer. Yes, at this point, the Roku 3 will NOT take advantage of the size, but may in the future. Also, the price was right. works well in my Samsung S5 no issue Couldn\\'t ask for more!  The biggest Micro SD Card for the most awesome phone the Galaxy S3!  Put tons of my music library on the card, full length movies, and have crazy space available.  I love having space to spare and not have to worry about every running out.Highly recommended!  Don\\'t buy this from AT&T; they are asking 130 dollars for the exact same card! was using it for my tablet before i decided to switch to my phone.So far so good its really fast I use this on my small ASUS 10.1&#34; notepad to get a little extra storage space.  Installs well and works great.  Just be sure you orient it right when inserting it without and adapter to protect it in a small slot like the one that comes with the ASUS.  Thought I was going to break it since it is so tiny and looks so brittle - but got it in ok. Slow compared to some usb drives. The good is it is small and will hold large files. I would recommend this product for cell phone only use. Not to be used as a back up usb memory drive for Nexus 7. I would use a high speed USB drive for the Nexus 7. I\\'ve started buying all of my SD cards with the adapter. These is no reason to limit myself with having a large card when I need a small one. At first I was concerned about connection reliability when the small card was inserted into the large one, but I haven\\'t had a single problem so far.This one performed as expected and otherwise is more flexible than a standard large size SD card. Fully recommended. I bought two of these Memory Cards for use with my Logitech Alert 750e Outdoor Master Security Camera\\'s. So far, I have found them to be unreliable. I am not entirely certain if this is because of the Camera system or the Memory Card themselves. The camera frequently will report a memory card error that indicates the card has to be reformatted. This is problematic as if the camera had recorded something that was important, the failure of the SD card would be very troublesome indeed. A well made replacement part for use with my system.  Reads and writes quickly to my camera.  The down side:  I do not like the size of this card.  Very tiny and often difficult to remove from my Canon camera.  Not a reflection on the San Disk card quality but the industry move into micro-miniture cards.  I won\\'t buy another camera using micro SD cards. The last few days I have been diligently shopping for a MicroSDXC card to utilize in my new smart phone. I have a long term positive experience using SanDisk cards. I quickly became confused about the differences between the so called \"Mobile\" Ultra cards and the Ultra cards. The performance specs to my \"intermediate tech experience\" eyes were virtually the same. The prices were also similar, with the \"Mobile\"version slightly higher. To finally resolve my confusion I contacted SanDisk technical support. To my surprise, the \"Mobile\" version is the older, no longer manufactured version. The Ultra is the current model. So I immediately bought the current Ultra version, which very fortunately AMAZON had on sale! No problems to report, works as described. Scandisk makes a very stable product for temporary storing and later transferring of images and video footage. I am cautiously optimistic but happy because Amazon sent my replacement promptly. I ordered a 32gb card and it came broken, so i returned with followed with an email asking for immediate shipping...and it arrived just in time for my trip. i am cautiously optimistic because out of four cards I have purchased from Amazon, this is the only one that works so far. but i got refunded for the rest. I put this micro-SD card in my Note II phone, and I have had a seamless experience with it.  Programs that are on the card operate as quickly and flawlessly as those that are on my phone\\'s memory.  It will hold dozens of programs, and gives me all the expandibility that I will need (unless I start collecting HD movies on my phone!).  This card seems to be designed specifically for smartphones, and does its job very well.  Recommended. A great memory card, at a very good price. I recently upgraded to this memory card for use in my cell phone, and it has plenty of space to hold all of my music, videos, and photos. I can download as many songs as I want, and take as many photos (at the highest quality) as I want, without having to worry about the memory on my phone filling up.I have used SanDisk memory cards many times before, and I have always had very good experiences. It is still too early to tell if this card will live up to that standard, but so far, this memory card has worked very well for me.The Class 10 rating refers to the speed with which it writes to the card, and I have noticed that it is quicker than my previous micro SD card. As an upgrade and expansion to your smartphone\\'s memory, I highly recommend this card! Using in a Surface Pro\\'s microSD slot.  I even reformatted to NTFS (which they claim is not recommended) in order to set up a virtual disk file on it and \\'automount\\' that virtual disk upon startup so that my music library can be on this (Win 8 is kind of picky about letting you set up what it considers \\'removable\\' volumes as directories to be auto-scanned for libraries, and this is one workaround.)Amazing to me that something the size of my pinky nail can hold my entire music collection at a nice high bitrate, and still have much more room left over.  One star off because its a tiny bit slow to write to but that might not be fair since I\\'m comparing to full-size SD and I did reformat, as I said. Love the quality of the Sandisk Ultra Class 10 card. It will be very valuable for storage on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1. Sam I brought this as a gift for a family member and was a hit at their party. Thank you bunches. Using it on my Galaxy s3, and it just worked out of the box.No problems whatsoever, was instantly detected and ready to go. I was surprised at the price and quality.  It works great and have not had any problems.  I recommend this for anyone needed a Micro SD card. I have several of these memory cards for our Canon DSL and it works perfectly - it is a must for the serious photographer who will take thousands of photos on a trip - fast / reliable /great product Got this for my Galaxy S3 android phone. As with most all San Disk products, it is high quality and I don\\'t expect any problems. My Galaxy S4 16 GB phone is now at 80 GB.  This will give me more than enough room for my music and then some. Came withing in 2 days and the price was good. Unfortunately it was such a good deal my granddaughter decided she should have it in her phone... so I am ordering another one. This is the second card I\\'ve purchased of this exact model.  The first one I had went bad after about 8 months.  To be fair, I had it in a rooted Galaxy S3 with CM10.1 loaded on it.  So it\\'s possible that something in the experimental firmware messed up the card.I\\'m back on the stock rom now due to issues with 4G LTE.  I\\'m not even rooted anymore.  So I\\'m hoping that the card remains solid this time.  Everyone else seems to love it so I\\'m hoping serves me well for a long time.So far... So good... I waited and waited to see this on the lightning deals, and I finally got it. It cost under $25.00, and I haven\\'t found it cheaper since. Actually fits and holds data vs others brands which didn\\'t work consistently. probably overkill in terms of size for most uses and requires special USB reader Hard to know what to say exactly about a memory card except that it does what it should at a good price.  Storage case is sturdy enough. The stock memory card that came with my Motorola Defy-XT was only 4 GB and I wanted to up the memory. This works quite well and was a good buy for the class 10 card. This went in a new Asus tablet with the latest android system in it. It read and was used with no issues. Not much to say about the memory card. It\\'s doing its job as expected. Bought mainly because it can store a lot information. I gave away my last card to a friend who needed one.  After reading the reviews for this card I purchased it.  I seems quick enough for my needs and plenty of space.  I\\'ve never had a problem with SanDisk.  My go to company for all my Disk needs. I bought this for my phone because the apps I was using were filling up the little space on the phone I had.  I had never changed out the card on a phone before but it was surprisingly easy and now I have tons of room for all my photos and apps and stuff. I use this with my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Tablet and it works Great. The SD card loads fast and I have had no issues. Bought this specifically for my GoPro HD camera for use as a dash cam, especially when driving or traveling in Mexico. Lots of room for recording road trip adventures. Popped them In our Phones and they worked as expected. My Windows Tablet came with a 32 GB Storage space allocation.  This allowed me to add the extra space I needed for applications, and media to let me use the tablet the way I wanted, and not be limited to the available storage space of the C drive. Have several of these for my video devices and they work great, Sandisk is a great product and have never had one fail in over 6 years. Great price too. Works great for the month I have had it in my Galaxy S3.  I purchased this to go in my Samsung Galaxy S 3 and was super excited I didn\\'t need to buck up more money for the 32GB phone.  Well *dumb* me did not know the the SG3 does not allow apps to be moved to an external SD card.  I thouhgt I had researched everything but I missed that.  The card works fin and I can store umpteen thousand pictures not that I have figured out how and I might even be able to figure out how to put a movie onto it but what a waste of a GREAT SD card.Pro: Top of the line cardCon: SSG3 and most new smartphones won\\'t allow apps to sd even with the micro sd card option on the phone I got this for my 3 year old\\'s Nabi. I can put tons of movies and tv shows on this thing and keep her entertained for hours. For the price it\\'s hard to beat. This memory card works great with my new GoPro Hero 3 Black. The footage looks incredible, and the filming time allows me to get a solid 45 minutes of action in. What can I say it\\'s a SanDisk Ultra 32GB MicroSDHC Class 10/UHS-1 Memory Card Speed Up To 30MB/s With Adapter...LOL It work and is still working well. Got this to use in my go pro camera.  It works great.  Get the no hassle packaging so you don\\'t have to have scissors to open it. I bought the Sandisk Ultra 32gb card for use in my Samsung smart phone.  Worked great for about 3 months.  Now the phone won\\'t recognize the card & neither will my computer.  Just went unreadable one day.  Very disappointed in the reliability of this card.  Will contact Sandisk as it has a lifetime warranty.  Shall see if they\\'ll stand behind their product. Got the card, took it out of the package, dropped it in my Samsung S4, rebooted and it detected it immediately.  No need to format or anything.  Haven\\'t done any speed tests, but I haven\\'t noticed any sluggishness that would warrant them, either. I wanted to upgrade my 8gb microsd card for my Samsung Galaxy S3 with more memory. The SanDisk Ultra 64GB Micro Sd XC I class 10 memory Card works perfectly.  Recognizes with 59GBs available blank.  My Mp3s, Mp4s, WMVs, pyvs, etc. all play on demand and without delay or problem.  Amazon shipped it with trouble free packaging ahead of time using their free shipping option (USPS) and I couldn\\'t be more pleased.  I highly recommend this memory card. Haven\\'t had a problem using these with my Hero3 yet. It comes with the little plastic thing to connect to any sd port. Yep, put this is our gopro & it\\'s fast enough for me. Small for my hands but it\\'d probably the last few years we have to touch things, before everything is wireless. Meaning wifi transfer in the future= changes for all these type of things. Worked as expected in both my Blackberry Z10 and my HP laptop and is plenty fast - writes at around 9.5MB/sec, but reads so far on my PC that I can\\'t get an accurate number for the speed. I gave it four stars because the write speed falls a touch short of the Class 10 rating - it\\'s honestly not enough to be an issue for me, but people who need the speed in a camera might be slightly disappointed. However, the capacity and price more than make up for that in my mind.Also, makes a great store for content in my Blackberry! I use it for my galaxy s4 and this card crashed on me few times, i lost all my photos and music. Thankfully they were all backed up but the worst part is, the card completely stopped working at one point. I had to contact sandisk for a replacement and it was a hassle. Works as advertised. This is better for using with the newer products. I have noticed a increase in speed with my Note 2 and Note 8 when compared with previous version of SanDisk micro SD. I got this to add some room on my Samsung Galaxy S3. It works great. I do not have any complaints. I use this card in my smartphone and it works great. It\\'s fast and roomy (I got the 16GB version) enough to store all the music and video I need. It was immediately recognized by my Samsung smartphone when I put it in about 6 months ago and I\\'ve had no reason to take it out ever since. The class is how fast the memory is read.  This is a fast card.  There are faster out there, but they are far more expensive, and not worth that expense, in my opinion.  Does everything perfectly and in a compact package.  SanDisk is a brand name, and trusted by me.  Worth the extra buck, since I\\'ve used SanDisk since they made 8MB CF cards&#8230;how far we have come&#8230; I wait for flash media sales to purchase SD card (various sizes).  I got the 64GB size for my GoPro 3+ and it works great.  I see no issues with the speed.  The price/GB was great on these.  Best of all this has been completely reliable for me.  No complaints whatsoever. This micro card has been seamless and simple to use.  The phone has not had any problems with this card. this item came on time nice works well  they want 12 more words i just dont have then . . Works on my Samsung Galaxy Note II. SanDisk is a product you can trust. Cheapest price I could find. Thanks! I love the card unfortunately my note 2 does not allow app install on the SD therefore i have not been able to fully test this card Already bought this one last may but you can\\'t beat the new price. Original Sandisk products never failed me before. Just be careful where to buy. I install it in my new Moto E and works great. It can save a lots of photos and it isn\\'t slow. Bought this for my phone so I don\\'t have to constantly transfer pics to my computer. Works great so far! Didnt know it came with an adapter card to make it into a normal micro card, super handy, fits in my tablet perfectly and reads fine. I thought this was a sure winner from the average 4.5+ rating with thousands of reviews.  But if you notice the bad reviews involve the card becoming unreliable after a couple weeks of use. Typically people write reviews shortly after receiving the product.  My card worked fine for 2 weeks and then started having problems.  I re-formatted the card, re-inserted in the phone, removed the battery, every trick I could read about but the card still remained unreliable and the phone was thinking it was being removed at random times.  So I stuck my olders, slower 8GB microSD card in, worked fine.I suspect one or both is happening with this card:(a) Some cards are defective but it takes some usage for them to start failing to where the user notices.(b) For some reason, this brand of card doesn\\'t like certain devices, like my Samsung Galaxy S3My guess is I got a lemon, but I\\'m not chancing it to getting another one and will just move on to another reputable brand.\"You get what you pay for\" may be applicable here.  But a lot of others did have success with this card.  So YMMV. Read the reviews and settled on this card to use in my cell phone.  So far so good.  No problems whatsoever.  Have tons of space to store all my mp3s, photos and videos.  Great read/access speed due to being HC-1 class.  Excellent price as I got this shortly after Black Friday sale. This actually came with the SD adapter making it a great buy. Lots of memory, MicroSD, SD and cheap. Can\\'t go wrong. works.  its an SD card, what did you want some kind of essay explaining the depths of flash memory.  No, you didn\\'t.  And you\\'ve probably heard of sandisk, so you know its probably reliable.  the only reason you\\'re looking at the reviews... *sigh*... why are you looking at the reviews of a microSD card?  seriously...  take a break, get off the computer and go for a walk.  i\\'m for real.  you know i\\'m right. I brought this for my wife\\'s Samsung Galaxy S3 phone and it\\'s work perfectly with it. It has a fast read and write speed. now, two phones later, and still have never had a problem! dont think, just buy it!Now im just waiting for 128gb chips haha SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s, super fast awesome memory card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 it was already formatted and ready to go.  just plug it in and start recording - nothing more to say for a storage device - just want it to work with no hassles. No issues with this. Formatted the cards I reviewed from Amazon. Put them in the devices and they\\'re running great. I like how this micro SD card is formated.My tablet wont read it though.I dont know whats wrong. I used it in my Droid Razr Maxx HD and it kept unmounting itself.  Then it became unresponsive and all my data was lost.  Now it isn\\'t recognized by my phone or my laptop.  Dead in the water. This  micro SD is very fast, I use it in a Samsung Galaxy Note II and I don\\'t have any problem regarding low speed. Using this as mass storage for my Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet 2. Have not done actual benchmarks, but I don\\'t notice a difference between this and the on-board flash memory. I have my My Documents folder redirected to this card, and I have also installed several programs to it. All seem to operate acceptably. This works great and is just what I needed for my phone to hold my 30GB (and growing) music collection. Now I don\\'t have to connect to the web to get my music, woohoo! It was an awesome price too. Took a little long to get here, but it Finally did. I admit I chose free ship, but ten days is still a quite a bit for this tiny thing. Got it for my new Galaxy S3 and it works like a charm. Super fast speed of transfer. Very much recommend it. Not much else to say really... except store it securely! D: You don\\'t want to lose such a tiny thing. Comes with an SD adapter, but no case, like the SanDisk Extreme 16 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Card I got, hence the four stars. I think I got 8 or 9 months out of this before it started to fail. It is still working intermittently but my phone will suddenly stop being able to read it for no apparent reason. &#34;Designed for durability&#34; my foot. It might survive in salt water but it didn\\'t survive in a phone that, frankly, doesn\\'t get a whole lot of use. This is the first Sandisk product I\\'ve ever had fail on me. It may still be under warranty but I don\\'t care. Now that I have to replace it I\\'m going to go with another brand. This review is for the SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A) that was purchased for me from Amazon.FRUSTRATING in a word. This card was reported by two different Android phones as damaged but my Windows computer recognized it with no issues. If the card had nothing on it or had just been reformatted then the phones recognized it but as soon as data, music or pictures were added then the phones reported the card as damaged. I had this card returned to Amazon after 3 days of sheer frustration.I read another review that suggested the Class 10 cards were not ideal for smart phones. I was already using a Sandisk Class 4 16GB card in another phone and had never had issues so I purchased a Class 4 Sandisk 32GB and it was as smooth as butter. Both phones recognized the card right away and added data, music and pictures seamlessly and quickly. The second card purchased was the SanDisk microSDHC 32GB Flash Memory Card, Black, SDSDQM-032G-B35 (Retail Packaging).In summary this card may work just fine for other devices but based on the sheer number of other reviewers (here on Amazon and elsewhere on the internet) that had similar issues with smartphones I cannot recommend this card for a smartphone. This is what I needed for my tablet and it works great. I will buy two the next time. thank you . There is nothing really to say except that I love having this much storage and not having to worry about running out. I finally have enough room for everything.  I formatted my 64gb Sandisk micro SD card using EaseUS Partition Master 9.2.1 Home Edition.  I used the FAT32 format.  My T-Mobile Prism phone read the card giving me 59.47 gb free.  My Samsung Galaxy 2 7.0 tablet read it the same way.  I am very happy that any of my devices will read this card when I format it as FAT32.  There is enough room to hold my my entire CD collection (300 cds), my entire book collection (250+ books), and my entire collection of sermons (I lost count).  I still have 23gb left!!!  I am too happy.  Bottom line, folks, if my cheap android phone will read it, so will everything else.  Who needs cloud drives and streaming when you can take it with you!!!!  Thank God for Sandisk,  I am hoping someone comes up with 128gb soon. hahaha! and the price is economical for the size it is, purchased this for my GO-Pro HD cam, works great adn the adapter allows me to instantly transfer the movies and pics to my computer. I purchased this for my GoPro Hero 3+. It works just fine; I have not complaints. I would recommend this item. I was very excited to buy this card (64 gb) for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - The product arrived promptly and I was able to format it to EX Fat and use it right away in my smart phone. However, exactly 10 days later when I removed the card (after turning off the phone) and inserted it in my Desktop, I got an error saying that the card was corrupted and unreadable and that I needed to format it.Since I had already got a lot of data on it, including a lot of videos and images of our new-born twins, formatting was not a viable option.I tried to get the card working on my PC Desktop, Mac Air laptop and the Samsung Galaxy Note, but to no avail.  Finally I decided to format it. There too, I kept getting errors and that the computer was unable to format the card.  Finally I tried \"Full Format\" via my pc - got an error again and then right away \"Quick Format\" and that worked - so the card is back and working in my Note again, but now I wont trust it anymore - not after having lost so many irreplaceable images and videos.I am a professional photographer, and use memory cards all the time - this has been the worst of the lot !! Stores thousands of pictures, and it worked perfectly in my Lumix camera using an SD adaptor.  Recommend to anyone who wants a 32 GB micro SD card. I love this Micro SD Card. I\\'m glad I bought it and I use it for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I have never gotten any errors with it so far or failures. 64 GB on a micro-SD card ... that itself was amazing to me and Sandisk has perfected the technology.No complains whatsoever, works great in my S4 ... have been clicking photos and videos ever since i put this in.It comes with an adapter, so you can plug it into your computer and download content easilyIts fast, even if it is almost full - unlike other cards i have used where it starts to get slow as disk space runs out ... not on this one, its fast. period.Few other reviews said it gets hot during operation, but honestly i did not notice anything .. not even getting warm.Also note that this is an SDXC card (different from SDHC), so please check if your device is compatible with it before buying it. Got this for my phone and it works great so far. Transferred music and pictures super fast from my computer to the card. Needed more memory and this is perfect. Purchased this for the GoPro Hero 3.I use the GoPro to record in-car footage at the track. this memory card fits a whole weekend event, which is about four hours of footage at 720p. This is one of the best. Bought it for my phone and works awesome. All the songs are now on this SD. I would like to give 5, but only adapter is bad on this. with adapter data transfer rate is very slow. That\\'s why i gave less rating. I have used this with Sony camcorder for more than a year now. It works well and copes with the high data volume of a camcorder video. I love SanDisk, and I have used quite a few of their products, including an mp3 player, a couple of USB keys and even a micro SD card (class 4). I have never had any problems. After installing this card, however, I have seen it unmounting itself randomly to be detected again and automatically being mounted by my Galaxy S4 device. This happens several times a day, including when I am in the middle of watching a movie on the phone (this is the first week that I have had the card). This is unacceptable. Normally, I would have just asked for a replacement, but after doing some research online, I have found out that this seems to be a recurrent problem on many phone models and doesn\\'t seem to be just \"a dud\", but a production issue. I have returned the card, and I am going to go with another brand instead. Got it on sale for the Samsung Galaxy Note II and it works great! Also came with an adapter which i believe will let you use it on your Wii or 3DS. Not much you can say about a memory card. It works or it doesn\\'t.Popped this puppy into the phone, was instantly recognized and is functioning perfectly. Very good price. Had this item for a week or so now and it seems to be working fine. I haven\\'t put it through any kind of stress or anything, just stuck it in my phone and let it do it\\'s thing. So far, so good. My hubby is now complete and very happy that he has ths for his Go Pro. Haven\\'t tested it out yet, but we will soon. Worked great for about six months in my s4 and last week it started having device connectivity issues.  The phone keeps saying ad card removed, resetting the phone lets the memory card work for maybe 30 minutes.  Very frustrating.I have 30 gigs of media, I would appreciate scan disk resolving this issue with me and the product It failed after about one year of using on a samsung Galaxy s4. Now I contacted Sandisk for a potential replacement. I can\\'t format it or do anythin wiith it. I used this for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 . Like the others are saying, it had to be formatted in Fat 32. You can put your apps on your SD card with an app called \"Link2SD\". You just have to partition the SD card in order to be able to use it. Whether you get this card or a smaller one, you need one period for the Tab 2 because you can\\'t do much without a wifi connection if you just have the internal memory and you want to download a lot of apps. There are a number of MicroSD manufacturers out there that offer large capacity cards like this. They claim to be Class 10 but when tested, prove to be closer to Class 6 cards in performance. This SanDisk card performs at the Class 10 level.I use these cards in various devices that NEED Class 10 speeds, such as my Android phone because of the data transfers I do for work and for the games I keep on it.If your device does not need Class 10 (you are just using it for simple storage of basic files like docs or ebooks) then you could probably save some money by going with Class 6. If the prices are very close, then you might as well spend the extra money and get Class 10.This card came with a nice plastic storage case and a SD adapter. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I feel the prices should be a lot lower by now. Inventory is plentiful and these are not cutting edge tech any more. My only gripe is I wish it were a bit cheaper, but you never need something like this when it\\'s on sale. I needed the extra memory in my Galaxy Tab and this filled the bill at the right price. I just wish you could load apps directly to this external memory card since the Tab is limited with 8gb for operating system, apps etc. This card is worth the cost. This was purchased to capture video with a GoPro Hero3, and so far it has performed splendidly. HD video takes up a ton of space, but this card will still hold quite a bit of it. Downloading is pretty quick and easy thanks to Class 10 speed. Super fast, works great on my Samsung S4. Had to make a few config changes on the S4 but that\\'s not the card\\'s problem :) This card runs great on my AT&T Note II, but it took some work to get exFAT working. Stock ROM, rooted, custom kernel. I can\\'t vouch for an unrooted, bone-stock device. However if you use custom kernels and want the benefits of exFAT, you have to find an exFAT-compatible kernel. I didn\\'t realize this and thought the card was working, but after installing a compatible kernel, everything runs great. Works with my Nikon D3200 camera and also my HP laptop, but for some reason my friend\\'s laptop (Dell) would refuse to recognize it/acknowledge its existence. Not sure if it was the card, the adapter, the computer, the port, or what. Card should work fine for anything, I think. Works much Better than the 64GB version, at least in the GoPro Hero3 when shooting at higher frame rates. Sometimes the camera stops recording at high frame rates when recording to xFat At 32 GB, this holds plenty of music, movies, apps and files. At about 75 cents a gig, this is a great deal. No problems in my Note 2.  Slid what I wanted from the original 16 GB card on to this and couldn\\'t even tell anything had changed. I mean that in a good way. Have ordered a couple of these 16GB class 10 microSDHC UHS-1 cards and they\\'ve done well by me. High transfer speeds, nice adapter, and no problems so far. Works with android phones/tablets easily, windows and mac machines so far from my tests. I\\'ve used this memory card in a couple of different devices, and in both cases, it\\'s performed quite well. It\\'s an excellent mix between needing something that will be reliable and always work, and needing something that doesn\\'t cost an arm and a leg. I\\'ve had far too many of the cheap no-name cards just stop working, and this one has never done that. Purchased for my cell phone. No problems or complaints. This is my second purchase and so far so good. I have several SanDisk products and have yet to complain. Did not do any tests but it works great in my Galaxy Note 2.  So far nothing wrong to report.  Recommended. SanDisk told me I needed to send this to them to format it. It will not recognize in any of my items. I read some reviews about the product being iffy, and mislabeled, but the one I got was just as advertised. My Samsung Note II recognized about 59.8 gigs, and the read/write speed is incredible. With the help of this, isyncr and rocket player, I have now permanently replaced my ipod classic. Couldn\\'t be happier. I accdientally dropped it in my garbage can and it got a tiny drop of water on it, but it still worked perfectly! sandisk cards are always faster read speed than sony\\'s cards (the competitor) and this card is muuuch cheaper than the competitors as well. therefore i have no choice but to give this a 5 star and a SERIOUS recommendation. Works well in my phone and gives me a decent amount of storage for a good price. I\\'d recommend it. I returned to order a 11.6 laptop so I could have full operations than having a Notebook. I am sure this is good quality as I have purchased San Disk numerous times. Fortunately I got this as a lightning deal, so it wasn\\'t that expensive.  I purchased it in October, but didn\\'t start using it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 until January.  It was fine, until it wasn\\'t.  It chose to die today.  Just a little more than four months after I started using it.  I checked my phone this morning and it told me that the SD card had been unmounted.  I did not think much of it.  But when I rebooted my phone and was still unable to find the card, I began to be concerned.  When I got home from work, I put a different card in, and it worked fine.  I tried to check the card on my computer, and it couldn\\'t be seen.  So the problem is definitely a card.  Unfortunately, I lost most of the pictures I\\'ve taken since getting this phone.  I know that I probably should have backed them up, but I really didn\\'t expect the card to fail so quickly.  Perhaps if I\\'d read all of the one start posts before buying, I would have.  Oh well, back to my 16GB Amazon Class 10 card until I can get a different one.I\\'m not even going to bother with a warranty claim.  I don\\'t need another card that will fail after four months. Good write performance. It sped up the time to load my pictures as well. This was a good buy. There are lots of manufacturers for memory cards but I feel most confident with Sandisk. Not much to say about SD cards -- either they work or they don\\'t.  This one appears well-built and required no formatting hassles and took to my Galaxy SIII as well as the original or better (the original Samsung card fried).  A month into it, and no problems. I bought this 64 GB unit for my new Samsung Galaxy S IV. I wanted the maximum size for music and the copious number of pictures i take of my kids and other things.I like the read and write speed on this card. I like the size but would have been happier with a bigger card but this is the max for my phone.Always happy with SanDisk, you will not be sorry you paid a little more.Edit: Should not have put \"they have never let me down\" in the title! 3 months in, I have been having problems with the SD card slot on my Galaxy S4. Not sure if it is the phone or the SD card moving in the slot. T-Mobile have sent me a new phone so we shall see.Edit 2: 4 Months in and I am having more problems with the same card. I received a new phone from T-Mobile and the same problem continues to occur. I have formatted the card twice and this gives a little time before the problem reoccurs. I have spoken to SanDisk and will call them again to have this card replaced. I will let you know how this goes. I cannot rate performance because of what I am using it for (files on an Android).  It can keep up with the modest requirements of this device.  Inserted chip, worked as expected.  No formatting, and no issues after a couple months use. It\\'s really hard to write alot about a memory card.  This one is great and works as promised. The capacity is why I purchased it so I can have all my files and music on my windows phone. I used this product with my Dell Venue 8 Pro.  After a couple months of use, it stopped letting me add new files or delete old ones.I tried reformatting and wiping the disk, but nothing worked.  Since the vast majority of the reviews appear to be positive, I assume I just got a bad one. We were going on vacation and I wanted to take a bunch of digital media for the long plane flights and for chilling during downtime. This chip took everything I needed and worked without issue. Glad to see the 128GB chips on the market, looking forward to the 256GB ones! I\\'ve never had a defective SanDisk SD card and this is no exception. They are well built and quality control is wonderful. I am especially sold on the 10 speed class and would highly recommend this for any type of media; books, movies, music, etc. The product is excellent, so far. It fits my smartphone and tablet also excellent in recording in HD also performing on an HD monitor.So far, all SanDisk cards (regular and Micro, have performed very well.excellent for my needs. I use three sizes 8 gigs for my Archos MP player and 16/32 gigs for my smartphone and tablet.My no name tablet has a micro HDMI port that works very well. If you need a memory card, this one works as advertised... It is fast and reliable.  I have never had a problem with this brand. It works, and puts 64GB in a chip smaller than my thumbnail.  The adapter also works and allows you to insert the micro card into your computer.  What is not to like? It isn\\'t as fast as the class10 I used before, and the file structure only allows 29.7G free to put data on.  I can see SOME loss, but I\\'m very displeased with losing over 2G of space!  That\\'s a big waste percentage. got this super cheap works great in my phone, now if I could figure out how to put music on the phone :) I have 4 of these in use in different devices.  I have had no issues with any of these cards, they\\'re all still working great. Nice to see name brand things that are cheaper then in the store.  I bought this either for my phone or tablet.  You never need to worry about running out of space.  The only downside to this is if you have big fingers this thing is small and hard to manipulate for it to go in the proper way and space. What more can I say. They always work for me. At one time, they were more expensive than other brands. If you look for deals, that is no longer true. I wanted a good quality micro SD for video recording my nephew\\'s wedding.  This was more than enough storage for a couple hours of mixed 720p and 1080p recording with plenty of room to spare.  Video looked good for the quality of video cam. Fast card, reliable performance.  Got this card for my Galaxy S3, no compatibility issues.  Would buy again for in a heart beat. Great price! Ultra rf has high speed and good stability, which is perfect for camera.I hope 64 g also drop the price. It does what it says but the price needs to come down. Alot. 3 stars bcuz it costs too much for what it is. Now who would have thought one day a memory card would be so small that its so easy to lose.I bought this MicroSD card to run openBSD on my beagle bone black:[...] title pretty much covers it.bought it for my GoPro - with free 2 day delivery (with membership) and the price it was a no-brainer works as well as a SD card can i guess, but its not 64gb its (59.45GB) not like it really is all that big a deal but i just found it strange. Works exactly as you would expect it to. Sandisk always makes great products that are of high quality, highly recommended. im using this card on my galaxy note 2 but it\\'s slow, and phone constantly unable to read the card The card works with a Galaxy Note 2.  Install was simple.There are some minor drawbacks I was unaware of when using card storage on my phone.I do notice an initial lag when first accessing the card.Transferring existing items onto card storage is not that simple.Not all items can be moved to card storage. Exactly as advertised. Works well, well known brand and I paid a fair price. What is there to say? It\\'s a nice big, cheap, effective, micro SD card. I use it in my Galaxy Note 8.0 for extra storage and it works fine. This card is great. Ive noticed slight improvement in every aspect of my phone. So much space! Very pleased. Came on time. Brand new. Easy to open thanks to Amazon. And it mentions on the tiny booklet that this thing is temperature resistant. Thats a big plus since overuse of smartphones tend to heat em up pretty good. Being from Texas, the heat out here only makes em hotter. And my last SD seems to have fried. Well this is a good buy. If i need another i\\'d definitly buy again. Maybe the black and gold one. It only available in 16GB but its super fast. no problems at all. works great Great price for the chip, fastest speed on the market, and fast service good job. 16gb is a great amount of storage for the price, even better than 32 or 64gb, great for cameras, phones, tablets, etc. Great storage. Runs fast and gives me plenty of room. Probably overkill for my phone but I\\'m all about overkill! Memory cards arrived on time and I was greatly appreciative of the frustration free packaging. If people would only stop stealing the stuff off shelves then we wouldn\\'t have to deal with the frustration free packing would we!Trued it out in my Samsung smartphone and it worked without a hitch. Good SD card and works fine with adapter.  Satisfied with purchase of this product.  Can fill it quickly though with HD video. This is the card that solved the problem with three dash cams that would not operate properly, the problem was the cheap wrong type SD Card, use this card and it works!!! I so wanted this to work but discovered when it was in transit that the Razor Maxx HD only supported a 16 GB micro card.  So I ordered the 16 and am totally happy.  I am tempted to by this 64gb again and give it a whirl. Super fast write speed makes using link2sd app work very well. Moving music and other media to this card from cable or reader is also much faster and im not completely sure but I think I can take photos faster as well. I used this sd in my psp (with an adapter) and works fine, all the games stored into this memory ran perfectly without lags Top of the line  data storage and expansion. Perfect for adding more storage to your phone or your tablet, and as always, SanDisk is reliable. For the one that are afraid of buying it to use with your tablet: good news. Is tiny piece of memory works fine with samsung galaxy note N8000. I had to do nothing. Just plug it. no problems at all. It runs smooth so far. I bought this micro SDHC card for my Nook HD+ device because I was going to install N2A and it worked perfectly. So far haven\\'t got any issues. I\\'m using it to record video with my GoPro and it works fine. I\\'m also considering buying another one for my cellphone :-) no problems so far using it with the included SD adapter on my micro 4/3 camera, no problem when shooting 60p HD video!so far so good! Reliable, no comments, it is a well know brand. I use it for my dash cam, the problem I have is with the dash cam (cheap Chinese). No much to say: it is worth every penny! just choose the amount of space you want and you\\'re done! For any camera and video recorder, I use them with d800  and d700 and are cool and  nice for both funtions I bought this for my galaxy note II and worked very good. Had no problem formatting and mounting.  Have copied lost of music on it and so far no issues. It does the job without any issue. I use it on my Microsoft Surface Pro Tablet. Fast and reliable. I would recommend it. the first 2 I bought both had multiple problems with not being recognized, this one so far has had no problems. No problems so far! Not much to say really. I got it for my Canon Power Shot and it works as it should. Came perfectly packaged and was easy to use. this item works as intended, well made, functions properly. good level of comfort fairly cheaply priced wont need to replace any time soon I got this card for the Samsung Galaxy S4. Installed and works without issue. Stores tons of photos and videos with fast playback and viewing. Bought this to expand storage in my Windows 8 tablet.So far, so good. (Minor point, the microSD slot on the T100TA is a bit too &#34;shallow&#34;, so the card protrudes slightly - keep that in mind if buying this card for that tablet.) These work great in my mobile devices,  they always work they are large enough to store lots of songs and movies for those long flights. What can I say about this memory card other than that it worked when in my phone after the old one caused all manner of problems. It does the job it\\'s supposed to. Bought this for my new Galaxy S4 and it works great. Class 10 is the way to go especially when slower cards are not much cheaper. Didn\\'t realize this was as small as it was, nice speed and great use cross device with the included adapter.  Lots of storage space for transferring files and films. This card is awesome. I take a picture on my camera and phone and it is almost instantly ready to take another picture. The transfer between my laptop and phone is very quick as well it almost match my USB 3.0 speed. Also i really like the color of the card. it makes the micro sd card look very unique. Although if you have verizon you may get confused between the LTE card and micro sd card. Fast and very easy to use.  Works with my GS4 and it is comparable with other devices.  Want to buy the 64 GB one. I\\'ve had this card for a couple months now and it is amazing, i use it in my phone so i can put stuff in there rather then use the space on the phone, its extremely responsive and extremely  fast as well, i had a SanDisk class 4 MicroSD card and this flies past that easily, usually when i would try playing music it would take a couple seconds to start, but using this it starts instantaneous , it was as if i had stored the music on the phone itself, i dont know what else you might use this card for, but if you are looking for a MicroSD for your phone, look no further Unless your really stringent on form factor (and negligible speed) always get these with the adapter. Some phones do not transfer data that quickly and the adapter is a life saver. Always have it in my PC when dumping large files. Speed is actually a big improvement over the 32GB card. I have found this chip works well even in conditions that aren\\'t ideal. I bought a 16gb galaxy s 3 and tried this chip but the phone has a flaw with the 32gb Microsoft chips so it worked for a month then would randomly eject the card when I didn\\'t do anything. I have a long term positive experience using SanDisk cards. I have been very pleased with the way these cards work in my Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0. No problems whatsoever and the capacity is huge.I quickly became confused about the differences between the so called &#34;Mobile&#34; Ultra cards and the Ultra cards. The performance specs to my &#34;intermediate tech experience&#34; eyes were virtually the same. The prices were also similar, with the &#34;Mobile&#34;version slightly higher. To finally resolve my confusion I contacted SanDisk technical support. To my surprise, the &#34;Mobile&#34; version is the older, no longer manufactured version. The Ultra is the current model. So I immediately bought the current Ultra version, which very fortunately AMAZON had on sale! This is a very capable microSDHC at a very fair price. I popped it in cell phone (Samsung Galaxy S4) and it got mounted without any hassle. I didn\\'t need any type of formatting. Read and write speed is quite fast while using while transferring data to my PC. Shipping was fast and tracking it was easy. This a product I highly recommend. This thing definitely improved performance over the standard card. Transferring music, videos and pictures seem so much more seemless than they were before. Prior to this card, I had a 16GB standard microSD card that just felt like forever transferring data back and fourth from my phone. I recommend this to anyone who uploads a lot of music and videos onto their mobile devices! Transfer rates make up for the slightly higher cost! SANDISK is now processing my RMA.  It was used in my Galaxy Note 2.  Its been over a week since I mailed it out. Fortunately they paid for shipping, but while it was working, it was awesome.. 64 gigabytes of class 10 accessible data, at the hands of your finger tips, literally MICRO SD sized.  wow, how technology has improved. It\\'s an sd card, this one\\'s fast. The read and write speeds are pretty equal on this one. Approaching 20mbits per second for read and write. I installed linux to this drive for my cubieboard. Yeah, read and write speed would definitely be an ultimate determiner of over all system performance with this credit card sized computer.Sandisk makes nice stuff don\\'t they? No formatting needed. Plug it in and it just works.Best Buy sells this same card for $100. They do price matching if you can\\'t wait for this to be shipped. Installed this in my S4 and it was immediately recognized by the phone. I performed a format from the phone just to see what it would do, but it didn\\'t give me any further storage capacity with the card. With card overhead it still adds nearly 59.5GB of storage capacity to my bloated S4.I tested moving existing applications, pictures, music, and other files back and forth between my phone and the card, absolutely no problems. If you\\'re not going to put a lot of music, pictures or applications on your phone, you\\'ll probably be fine with no additional storage. However, if you\\'re going to add any storage capacity to your phone, why not maximize it with a 64GB card for about $50? Got the SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A on December 28, 2012, died on May 20, 2013Could not write to it or change any data, no matter what device i used. Even after format (Full & Quick using disk manager & EaseUS Partition Master 9.1.1 Home Edition, connected in a device or adaptor or usb adaptor) when disconnected and reconnected no change. Dropbox saved my data luckily (Had it syncing using Dropsync Pro).Was using it with Samsung Galaxy Note 2 T889 for the whole time, never was removed. Perfect card for so many uses, holds a lot, no skips or blips. Nice quality at an affordable price, never had a problem with SanDisk and this one is no different. I bought this to because I wanted to upload music to the disk for my off the computer listening, this does not support music files so I have no need for this. I\\'ve tried hooking it up with the Flash card it came with, I\\'ve tried putting it in my phone and hooking my  phone to the computer, I\\'ve tried through my mp3 player...nothing. I can\\'t even get Windows Media to recognize the flashcard. If you\\'re looking for more storage for portable music don\\'t buy this. So, essentially you have about 28 - 29 GB, but it seems to be quite a bit for me. I have yet to use even a quarter of that, and I take pictures every week. I had a problem with how it transferred some videos to my computer once, but that my be because I forgot to format it and prepare my tablet for removal of the SC card.It is definitely surprising how small it is! Be careful not to lose it! Works wonderfully. I had this sd for over nine months and it is still working great. I had trouble getting it to recognized at first by my S3.Formatting from phone and or generic windows format menu did not resolve this issue so I downloaded EaseUs partition master and formatted and it has been working like charm ever since.Write Speed: 8.4 MB/s @ default cache speed.Read Speed: 37.9 Mb/s @ default cache speed. I purchased a Samsung 7&#34; I primarily use as a reading device. I can now place a number of PDF books to chose from.  Works like a charm. I haven\\'t figured out yet if I\\'m a dummy or if I have a defective card.  I don\\'t know if the card is bad since I can\\'t even get the card to stay in my Samsung Galaxy S4.8.  The little card will go in (the larger one won\\'t) but it won\\'t stay in.  If I put pressure on it the Samsung says .. preparing SD card but as soon as I release pressure the Samsung says .... card removed.This card came from a source outside of Amazon and took way to long to get here.  It arrived in a white envelope with NO instructions.  I\\'m very upset about this purchase as I\\'ve never had a problem before with either SanDisk or Amazon.  I\\'ll try to find someone with more experience than me to give this a try before I return it.  I would have expected this to come in a package from SanDisk, like other SanDisk products I\\'ve bought in big box stores or from Amazon but it did not. I use these with my GoPro Hero3 and to date I haven\\'t had any issues with them. I have two of these and they record about 8 hours of video each, so theres more than a day worth of filming you can do these. But since I can\\'t say with any certainty whether it was the phone or the card, I\\'ll just say it\\'s a middle of the road product. When it did work though, man it was BLAZING fast read speed. I got this during Amazon\\'s SanDisk sale.  It works like a charm.  64GB addon to my Galaxy S3.  Need I say more? Bought this memory card to work with myBarnes & Noble NOOK COLOR eBook Reader (WiFi Only)it added a much need memory boost to a already great product.  I am now able to transfer many more .pdf , .epub, and other files to my Nook.  Good job whoever made these things. The SD slot on my laptop recognized this card immediately.  When I put it in my Droid Razr Maxx it recognized the proper amount but the phone required a reformat.Since install my phone has had some instability but I haven\\'t had enough time to troubleshoot to determine whether or not it is due to the card.  Motorola says the phone can handle 32gig cards.  Some users have reported the 64gig works fine. Other users have reported problems with the 64gig card. Other than the phone instability the storage on the card seems to be working fine for now. Good item came well packaged and been working fine so far only thing is it will not connected when using the adapter when connecting it to My PC. I got it, formatted it for my phone, and it seems to be working perfectly.  I am able to transfer and open files at a good speed, and I have had no problems with it.  Good product! i bought this for only one use, to put in my samsung galaxy s3. i popped in the card, mounted and formatted in settings, and it works like a charm in the phone. HOWEVER(it\\'s in caps pay attention!), when i took it out of the phone and put the microSD into the SD adapter and plugged into the sd card slot on the front of my pc(win7 x64) it asked to format the card(was already formatted by phone so was confused) so i hit ok, no biggie, it was empty anyways. windows did its thing and when it was &#34;ready to use&#34; it said the card was only 1MB(it showed 59.47GB in the phone). so my troubleshooting section of mind kicked in and i removed the card, and i just so happen to have a microSD slot in my computer\\'s frontal bay and it wouldn\\'t even show it was connected in windows explorer. so i took it out and put in another microsd card, voila it read, switched them out again, and nothing. so i decided to pull up my paragon hard disk utility, and it showed the same thing as windows, regardless how i tried formatting it. i gave up and put it back in the phone and mounted it.my s3 said it neded to be formatted. so i formatted it in the phone again and it showed just like it did the first time, 59.47GB. i then proceeded to install samsung kies and got my phone hooked up to my pc via usb cable, i opened the phone in windows explorer and right there it shows the phone memory at ~16gb and the sd card at 59.47 gb....i\\'m not quite sure what\\'s going on with that, because the sd slots in my pc read my other cards just fine. but anyway i guess if you plan on using it in your phone or possibly other device exclusively because i can use it like a charm while it\\'s in my phone, otherwise it seems pretty useless. so i guess just depends on what you\\'re using it for. on a side not, be careful when you open the plastic package that contains the micro sd and sd adapter, be sure to open it over a large clear area, i opened it up the the living room with black tile floor and had to get a flashlight to find it when it jumped out on the holder(it just sets in the little plastic holder so even the slightest shake will send it flying when opening) i\\'m giving it 3/5 on here, but 5/5 if you\\'re getting it for a phone, galaxy s3 at least because it works fine in mine This little SD card is pretty amazing.  It is really fast and there was no issues when installing it.  It even came with an adapter so you can use it as a regular SD card. What can I say. 64 GB in a microSD card. ~30mb/s transfer speed while inserted into my laptop. Works great in my S4. Can\\'t really go wrong with this price either. I bought this specifically for my COWON J3, as it comes with 32gb of internal memory, adding 64gb got me almost to 100gb. That\\'s 3x the original capacity that player has.This card is formattable to FAT32, thus allowing you to use it with some of the older SDHC devices. I know not many of the buyers will even consider this ability, but I figured I\\'d throw it there for those that might be interested.The card is fast, I\\'d post benchmarks but you can just google for a ton available already. Also with 30mb/s speeds this wouldn\\'t make a bad Camera SD card if you absolutely needed one someday. Just stick it in the SD adapter and you\\'re rolling.I tested it with my Canon T3i, worked flawlessly, however, not as fast as my other 90mb/s card. they took almost 3 gigs for themselves(formatting purposes) but am satisfied till i need to take my s4 up to 64gigsno issues to report what can go wrong? right? it works and fits what else is there - great price and i love the adapter purchased this item to store movies for use in my sons nabi 2. Works perfectly and at a great price. Love SanDisk and loved the price. I feel a little cheated, they state that this is the best for android phone yet it failed. I never even removed.i have had other memory cards last me years upon years.  Have to look for another one so disappointed. The phone moved smoother but not sure it is worth it Works great in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Well worth the money and the price is affordable. A great sd card. it\\'s an inexpensive way to expand the 16GB tablet we bought for my wife\\'s sister, who wants big storage.  was pretty easy for the tablet to detect it. it\\'s very fast micro sd card i use it for my mobile and gopro camera , sandisk is the best ever The last I heard this memory card works great. I gave it as a Christmas gift. The person I gave it to says it works great. I use this on my 32 GB Microsoft Surface RT and it does the job as advertised, so 5 stars.I have used it to extend the storage capacity on the tablet to 64GB for storing documents, pictures etc. There are many articles on the internet that show you how to do that. this chip holds way more than i would normally need but we were going on a three week trip and potentially taking about a million fotos.  if you need a large capacity this card was fast for the writes and reads for all the fotos i took.  the largest fotos were in the 10-12 MB range but most were 5-7 MB.and there were at least 15000 shots, some were absolute crap but that is the great thing about DigiFotos, the film is cheap.i bought mine here for $50.47, and that is STILL a good price i think for the ability to capture so many fotos and videos (and data if you wish). I own a first generation Microsoft Surface Pro 128, and it has been a good machine but I was really finding it challenging working within the constraint of 128GB of storage space. I had a 64GB Class 10 SDXC card, which worked well but was not going to fit the VMWare virtual machine I wanted to run off the SD storage. The Virtual Machine increases in size with regular use, and the operating system I was running is recommended for at least 40GB of max storage to operate properly.  Combined with the files I needed to store, and 64GB memory chip was no longer sufficient.The SanDisk Ultra 128GB MicroSDXC Class 10 Memory Card was able to handle that with ease, however I have found that the virtual machine ran noticeably faster off the 64GB chip than this one. I\\'ve actually ordered a second of these to see if I might have just received a flawed chip. If the replacement chip offers improvement I will revise this review. It provides its main selling point, more storage at a relatively low cost, so far has run reliably in my tablet computer.If storage space is a significant issue for your device and the memory can make use of 128GB SDXC, then I would recommend product. This card is great for the price it\\'s exactly what I ordered. Works great with my Samsung S4. Plenty of memory. The card works well. Purchased 64 GB to use in my phone as that will store a lot of pix and tunes! Ah, but the phone does not recognize the 64, and I can only use about half the memory. great price especially for the size and speed, this maxed out my Note 2 smartphone and I am very pleased with the speed of delivery and the cost. 64GB is pretty good size, and in a cell phone, it\\'s awesome. However, getting it formatted as FAT32 is not the easiest method. By default, Windows 7 will not allow anything larger than 32GB to be formatted as FAT32. Even if you execute a DOS command to format to FAT32, it will fail. There is a fix though. Ridgecrop Consultants Ltd has a program that can be downloaded. I would suggest that you support this free application by sending the guy a few bucks, as he has truly written a great program that works very well in Windows 7. I have used his program, &#34;fat32format&#34; to successfully format this 64GB MicroSDXC disk. I then copied all of my contents from my old 12GB disk to this one. I inserted the disk into my phone, and whalla! It works great! Very pleased with this purchase. Very happy with this card. It gives my 32gb Galaxy Note II an extra 64GB of Storage and it\\'s fast. Good card for the price.  Lots of room for music  Plays in the Sansa MP3 without any difficulty or trouble I use this to hold all 22 gigs of my music on my galaxy S3. And I still have room for several seasons of a TV show. Definitely a great product.The only thing I can complain about is there is a one second gap between songs, At least using Google music. I suppose that\\'s the price you pay for this large of storage Well, it\\'s a SanDisk. Never had an issue with one and this one was no exception. Good product. Good price. Works as expected. Very fast writer. Too bad the reader I bought with the disk doesn\\'t work as well as the disk. I have been using the device for couple weeks, so far no issue.The writing speed is slow, which might be the problem on my laptop not the card. While the class 10 speed is excellent (it\\'s amazing when files will initially transfer at 200MB/s before settling down to ~19), you do need to use a reader with proper SDXC support, and manually format the card in a good partitioning program, like minitools or easeus. That alone should disqualify it from 5 stars, for lack of user-friendliness. But if it weren\\'t for that, the fast, roomy card is a wonder to own. I can\\'t believe how fast this is.  i had a class 10, 32GB card by imation and it was nothing like the speeds I get out of this. I have been using it for several months in a helmet cam, several times a week. No problems so far. Bought this for my phone and it works without any flaws. if you have a Microsoft Surface or phone that takes these.  I use it in my elago drive and Nikon DSLR. 06.NOV.2012 - Bought the card.12.JAN.2014 - Card failed.It cannot be formatted or used in any way.It lasted 14 months and most of that time I was not even using it. 64GB SDXC for $50...ish!!! Amazing price for a great product. Popped it into my Galaxy S4 and have had no problems so far. Very fast read and write, works great right out of the box.  Would buy again if I need another one. This rocks with my galaxy s3 android. I\\'ve got it loaded with movies and pictures for the slow times in my taxi. I have this installed in my BlackBerry Z10. I have the camera on my phone set to store directly to this little card. It\\'s really a great feeling to take photos all day long and not worry about filling the card up. I really recommend it if you have a phone that allows for external memory expansion. Sorry iPhone users. NOTE:  please read the last update (scroll to the bottom) - I\\'m leaving this review as 1 star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience.I give SanDisk 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for the product (for those manufactured in the past)  For those newly manufactured products that contain the software ROM fix, I\\'d give the product 5 stars.To all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews.... and then used it in a Galaxy S4 (GS4) smartphone for storage, the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to SanDisk for a replacement under warranty.  Believe me I tried everything that the Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT, formatting in the GS4 then copying data to the card while in the phone etc.... nothing worked... and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which I hope to get soon (just RMA\\'d and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed from the SanDisk customer support rep when I asked specifically asked him):- When used in the GS4, this card will unmount itself inadvertently (may be true only for cards manufactured before the ROM patch described below was implemented in manufacturing).  This can cause the data to become corrupt (luckily was not my experience) and / or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving 13 MP camera pictures to the card (or MP4 movies that stop in the middle of the movie) and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse, right when you take the picture (this was the issue I experienced).- SanDisk knows about this issue.  Again, SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) and they WILL take care of it under warranty.  They have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it. (sorry SanDisk about the 1 star, but I thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution)- The customer rep told me that SanDisk tried to work with Samsung to resolve the issue but Samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones with cameras, obviously) and even worked fine in some phones from HTC etc. that could accommodate the 64 GB cards. Hence the 5 star ratings from others.- The solution SanDisk came up with was to write a patch into the ROM of the card itself to specifically address the issue on Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones like the GS3).  I was assured that the new card I would get would work flawlessly. will see in about 3 weeks.- I purchased my card from Amazon June 2013, so the ones currently being manufactured and the one I should get will have the new patch.  However, as SanDisk manufactures in batches (like most of the industry), old batches of \"unpatched\" cards obviously exist in warehouses.- I asked about a software patch I could download and was told it\\'s not possible... hence the \"hard coded patch\" in the card\\'s ROMSo... how to take care of the problem....After speaking with the SanDisk US customer support (link and info below), this is what I learned and did.Go to the SanDisk site1) [...]2) call consumer products support (this is the US no.) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your GS4 (I assume this is also a problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information, approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously), and then send you emails with a UPS return label and instructions.5) BTW, they also asked if I had a magnifying glass to ID the serial no. on the card, but I didn\\'t and couldn\\'t read it myself (those numbers are super small printed into the plastic... don\\'t believe me?  take a look yourself.)  I told the rep I couldn\\'t read them and he said no problem, they would process without the serial no.  I assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in.  Makes sense.Well, that\\'s it.  Problem (hopefully) solved.  Let\\'s see in 2-3 weeks.  The rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem.  KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however, it would be nice if there was some type of communication / notice of the issue besides Google info sources, forums etc.  I spent hours, maybe a couple of days total hours worth, thinking it was an issue with my phone / my data transfer.  oh well, that\\'s how it goes.I really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me.  GOOD LUCK!!(btw, I\\'d give the card 5 stars if this problem was solved in the patched ROM of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card (tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer)... if the data transfer / remaining mounted in the GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM, of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013 - All went well with the return of the SanDisk Storage card.  UPS shipping took about 2 days from when I sent it, SanDisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later and 5 hours later that same day, my replacement card had been shipped. waiting on the new card now, but expect to test it out very soon (early next week).  will update the post after testing out the new card.  Just as a reference, I\\'ve been using a 32GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card in the GS4 since having shipped the 64GB card.  Obviously it\\'s a different card and not the Micro SD XC kind. Other than a bit slower access speeds to the card, absolutely zero problems.... well if you don\\'t count that it\\'s basically filled up, hence why the 64GB option is great on the GS4. So it proves the point on the problem with the early build Micro SD XC 64GB cards.I\\'m happy to see that my review has helped some others out there.  Good luck to you in your warranty claim. my experience with SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far.Update: 08/21/2013 - Received the new replacement SanDisk Storage card just a few days ago (shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window).  Have had it running in the Galaxy S4 for a few days now without any jumps, stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking.  Card seems to work flawlessly as the SanDisk Rep mentioned it would. One would think it\\'s such a short time to test after a few days of use, but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first 45 minutes... that\\'s how often and how fast it was occurring. so it would seem the problem is solved. The new SD card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card.  Thanks SanDisk!  Unless I update this review by next week, you will know that the problem has been fixed.Good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to SanDisks great responsive customer service.Update: 08/31/2013 - This is the last update to this review just to \"close the loop\".  The new replacement card from SanDisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now.  I have not experienced any of the initial problems.  SanDisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards.Update: 12/09/2013 - The card has been running in my GS4 flawlessly since replacing it around Aug 21st.  Pretty good track record so far (~ 3.5 months) so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured (replacement) cards.For those that have left comments that I should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed (see my addition at the beginning of this review)... When searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product, most people start at the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced.  This is especially true for products with a lot of reviews (this is what I did in the beginning with this product).  Therefore I think leaving it at 1 star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review.Thanks to review commenter \"Da Shocker\" for his input.  I think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this:\"One more thing.. to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one. Take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star. A card cost $50-$100 pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless.. \" Got this micro-data card for a digital camera that shoots in HD. it came with a class 4 card but the video clips were blocky. I had a class 6 and tested it in the camera with some improvement and at the advice of youtuber Techmoan (this guy does the best tech reviews on the web) I ordered this class 10 card. It solved the blocky issue and is a great value for the money. Arrived earlier than expected. Been using it about a month now. Easy installation into my LG Optimus G Pro. $50 for 50-something more gigs, deal. Everything works great on my note 2. I can even do super slow motion video and have never had a dropped frame. I purchased this for a cheap Android tablet.  I figured I\\'d try a cheap tablet first, and if I decided I wanted to go with an Android tablet, I\\'d get something good later.  But either way, the memory card will be used in one item or another, so I wanted to get a good one.  Like any other SanDisk product I\\'ve purchased, this card is top-notch.  Comes with the (in my opinion, necessary) SD card adapter.  Class 10 speed really makes a difference when you have the card filled with music/movies/apps. I bought this for my Sony action cam.  At 720p@30fps I get 11 hrs of recording which is awesome.  This card is more than fast enough for that cam.  The price was great too.  It comes with the regular SD card adapter so don\\'t worry about buying one in addition.  The packaging can be difficult to get into though. I\\'ve had this card for about a year and I\\'ve been very careful with it and it just broke when I popped it out of sd card slot on my phone but it was very reliable card when it wasn\\'t broken Since my Samsung S2 could not take the 64GB card, I bought this one. Like I expected it works great and no problems so far. Never had a problem with any sd cards prior, and always had a good track record with sandisk products.Card was working great at first, used exclusively in my Samsung galaxy S3. Enjoyed the extra space(got the 32gb card) and transfers were pretty quick. I started to see (about a month ago) that the phone would randomly give me \"sd card unexpectedly removed\" error maybe once a week. The last 2 weeks, I also started seeing (frequently) \"sd card safe to remove\" randomly pop up at least once a day as well as the \"unexpected\" removal error every few days. Today the card stopped reading all together.The card was first inserted w/ the phone off, when I bought it. Although I never formatted it, it worked properly. I also never removed the card from the phone in order to possibly corrupt it from improper removal, so the card just seems to have died of it\\'s own accord. I never thought to check it\\'s temperature after transferring large files so I\\'m not sure if I had the same issue as another reviewer.Contacted Sandisk, waiting for reply. If they replace the card and it works well, I will revise this review.UPDATE: 2-28-13got a replacement card after about a week and a half, Sandisk supplied a shipping label for me which is always a plus. I\\'ve had the replacement in my S3 for 3.5 months now and still going strong. I\\'ve also used it with the adapter in my goPro. Card is working well and hopefully it continues to do so. Updated to 4 stars since I haven\\'t had a single problem with this card (the first one started showing issues fairly soon after installing). Maybe there was just a bad batch of the card for spell there. Decent price on 16 GB. Works as it should, no problems. Not sure if the speeds actually matter with mobile devices. Maybe for transferring media to PC faster actually helps. Either way, it works great. This is my second time to buy this product and will give it as a gift to my friend. Packaging is nice and received in good condition. The 64GB card I purchased actually contains 4GB of flash memory and some kind of hack that causes it to appear as a 64GB drive in various drives and readers. Of course, this took me a while to figure out since I only just got around to copying more than 4GB of data to the card, but with some testing I have nonetheless discovered this to be the case.The card I bought was in Amazon Frustration Free packaging. I don\\'t know if cards purchased that way are less likely to be counterfeit than retail packaged versions, but I suspect that I will stick with manufacturer packaging from now on. I have purchased 2 of these cards.  I have attempted to use them in my GoPro HeroHD, Samsung Galaxy S4, Asus TF700, and in all of them they end up corrupting out of the blue with no warning.  I then have to perform a deep recovery to get the files.  I will never buy these Ultra models again. had to send it back to SanDisk.  They did replace it at no cost - which is nice - but still ... if I had lost a bunch of data I would have been pretty bummed.  I used it in my phone to store music.  one day i turned on my phone and it said &#34;can\\'t read card&#34;  that was it - i tried putting it in my computer to reformat, wasn\\'t even recognized as a drive at all. I use the SanDisk products for long time now. They never failed me! They have an amazing speed writing and reading and also long life durability. Not much to say..bought it to use with my smartphone. It works as expected and allowed me to free up my internal memory. again just what you need to get those shots. you can never have enough memory cards. really glad I was able to get one While SanDisk\\'s packaging makes much mention of Android phones and tablets, there\\'s nothing Android-specific about this microSDHC card. I bought the 32GB version to use in an automotive \"dashcam\", where it works perfectly.The packaging also says that an Android app is \"included\", suggesting it is preinstalled on the card, but the (very!) fine print on the back says you have to download it. Unlike another SanDisk flash product I got recently, there was no \"bloatware\" preinstalled on the card.I like that this card is also said to be resistant to temperature extremes, important to me as it will be behind a car windshield and will get hot at times. Used this in my GoPro camera.  Works great. I\\'m so disappointed in SanDisk. I bought this for my Galaxy S3 phone. Worked great for the first few months. Suddenly I noticed some pictures were missing. Then it kept giving me an error that the \\'SD card has unexpectedly stopped working\\' then i tried popping out the card and popping it back in. Now it says unrecognizable files and it asks to format the mp3\\'s I had bought and stored on the microsd card. In a pinch just to see if this would fix my issues I formatted the disc. Now I lost everything and it is still giving me issues. Read some similar issues from other customers, now I\\'m regretting my purchase. Save your money and headaches and buy something else! I use this microSD card with my Android tablet all the time.  I store lots of movies and books on it, and it works great.  Highly recommend it. Go two during a &#34;Deal of the Day&#34;. Could not test USB3.0 performance since I dont have a USB3 port. Used primarily as a portable hard-drive (content back-up and file transfers).  Working well for this application.I have this attached to a small key-chain USB adapter and really like the compact nature of the microSD card With most of the world\\'s electronic devices finally standardizing to SD (thank you Sony for finally adopting this standard), it seems most things we own work on either the microSD or regular SD card.  That\\'s why this little package is so handy.  You get both in one neat little package and at 64GB, you\\'ll have plenty of space to store most of your programs, files, etc on your device.The Class 10 rating (ability to move data on/off card at the current maximum speed) is a must for anyone that doesn\\'t want to sit for vital seconds waiting for data to write to the card.  And SanDisk has proven themselves over the years as making a quality product.  Sure, you may occasionally find a dud in their inventory, but they are quick to fix/replace it and that is what matters most.  Buying cheaper cards will land you with a read/write error when you can least afford it.  Don\\'t be the person that loses those important family photos or that document that is due today because of a cheap and defective card.I purchased this particular card for my Asus Transformer, as it fits nicely into the pad itself - and with the optional keyboard attachment (which is capable of holding standard SD cards) it fits there as well.  Making this the perfect solution for my extra memory needs and at a much better bargain than most competitors.  You can certainly purchase more internal memory on your iProduct or Android device (most seem to have 16GB or 32GB variants), but why spend the extra cash for 16GB extra, when you can buy far more in an external card? Got this card in early January for my Samsung Tab2 10.1 tablet.  Within a couple of weeks, it was loading music files incorrectly onto the card.  I did not know what was wrong, but finally thought I would format card again to see if that would correct the problem.  Card would not quick format or format slowly.  As always, Amazon is taking care of the problem and I will have replacement card within 24 hours!  Hope the replacement is more reliable.  I am just writing it off as a fluke, as I have never had a problem with a SanDisk product in the past.2/14/13:  When I called Amazon they replaced it - to my door - within 24 hours!  Replacement works fine.  Now that is GREAT service! I used to use an 8GB one n I recently upgraded to this one as I have bigger need. Put it into my mobile as soon as I got it n it works well. Quite easy to use n I use it for storing all my music/ pictures on my mobile n sometimes upload movies when I go on long drives. Sandisk is a great brand n its definitely worth it. April 2013.  I have had the card for about 4 months and seemed to work fine.  I use it to store additional files on my ultrabook as the solid state drive is small (only 128GB).  About a month ago, the card could not be recognized.  It only lasted about 2 hours, so I thought maybe just a momentary blip.  However, this weekened, it cannot be recognized at all and it has been 3 days.  Sandisk support is not available until the week, so I will update on tech support soon.  However, I did find that the SanDisk indicated there was a defect with some of these cards.  I assume they will replace it, but I have lost lots of hours and a lot of pictures... so I am really bummed and frustrated.From SanDisk: \"SanDisk has been made aware of potential product issues involving a very small percentage of its 32GB and 64GB SanDisk Mobile Ultra microSD cards. Under certain circumstances the cards may lock up and the card becomes inaccessible. The issue has been identified and a manufacturing fix has already been put in place. SanDisk stands behind its products and any customer who experiences this issue with the microSD cards cards is asked to contact the SanDisk support center for a resolution immediately.\" SanDisk I got this product exactly 1 month and 3 days ago. Prior to today, it was working fine. Out of nowhere, my Micro SD card can\\'t be read anymore. I\\'ve tried several phones, and 3 different laptops (both OSX and Windows 7), and it doesn\\'t even show up anymore. Be weary of the product. You may end up with a lemon. I use it to store my music on my android. Works great. Doesn\\'t use that much battery power and doesn\\'t slow down the phone much at all. Tried this out today in one of those \\'Memory Stick PRO Duo Dual slot adapters\\', basically you use two microSD cards in one and then use it for your PSP, or camera, or whatever.  Worked great, two 32 GB cards were just a little cheaper than one of these and I wanted my nephew to upgrade to 128 GB if he wanted.  The adapter didn\\'t say it would work with XC and we were worried that the PSP would have a problem with it but it all worked out great.  He is upgrading to 64 GB from 2 GB, it was a little overwhelming.  He has lots more space now and might get another one of these cards to put in the same adapter.  I\\'ll update this if anything goes wrong. Simply works, what else matters?  Why does Amazon insist on a minimum number of words?  This is a simple product that works.  That\\' s all that needs saying. If you can get this sd card on special or discount, please grab it up!!  I currently have this in my Surface RT and this has become an instant (fast) 64g of storage.  SanDisk makes very reliable products.  I would highly recommend. I gave it five stars, simply because I am not a tech genius, so I don\\'t know if it is the best or not - but jeez, this thing is fast and it does everything that I wanted it to do. I have no complaints so far. I\\'m a very happy customer and I would definitely recommend this product to someone who is looking at buying an affordable micro SD card. I use this memory card for a car DVR.  Absolutely no lag in recordings.  The DVR cannot fully use the transfer rates of a class 10 memory card but no issues with recording or sound.  Will buy again and again. this is a great card and product, just need to watch out for device compatibility. Got it on sale for the Samsung Galaxy Note II and it works great! Also came with an adapter. I use this card for watching workout videos on my smartphone so I can do them outside. It works great. Replaced another brand Class 10 32 GB micro SD card for my phone.  I didn\\'t know how bad I had it before I put this in and started transferring files.  It was so much faster than my previous one. I am pleased.No issues with delivery or description. Transfer speeds are amazing, never corrupts files like my old card and it has tons of space! 64gb is really a bunch, spesh for music lovers like myself, itndelivers on recording capabilties too, does not dissapoint. I get a steady 15mb/s transfer which is well over the 6mb/s i was getting with my old class 6. Higjhly recommemd. I got mine for $41 with prime shipping. AND YES THEY WORK IN THE GALAXY S3/S4/S2, DROID RAZR/XT912/HD/MAXX/MAXXHD, WII U, you just have to format it properly. On stock format you get the full 30+ mb/s transfer speeds, yes. But through your phomes which is only LIMITED TO ITS HARDWARE you get half that. Youre only limited to what the hardware can handle. Thats why they recommemd the 32gb cards as its differect architecture. People complain about the speeds using programs. Psh, my new usb 3 car reader tells me i get 60mb/s transfer rates! So stuff it!Excellent card, excellent quality. I threw it in a cup of ice water and stirree it up in front of my friends and let it sit for an hour while i drank the water and played video games. Then took it out and dried it off and let it sit for a minute or two to warm up, threw it back in my phone and to everyones amazement..it still worked. SOLD. hahaBoht two, looking to buy 2 more, now if amazon would only drop the price to $40 again. I wanted a place to store my music on my phone. This card works great. I haven\\'t tried the adapter yet, though.Also, so much storage! It served its purpose - no complaints, I used it for my samsung device andI am still storing on it. Works great in my GoPro 3 Black. I will only buy SanDisk. If you want a name you can trust this is it. Comes with an SD card adapter.  Not much I can say about an SD card, but I would recommend it for the price! I bought this memory for my Microsoft Surface RT. It works great and it is super fast. I am storing movies, music and pictures. Great! Bought this for a surveillance camera, but ended up using in my nook HD+....Works fine! I\\'ve bought a few of these over time through Amazon, have never had a problem with them. I\\'m not going to go into any technical specifications here.It\\'s enough to say that this SD card does exactly what it is supposed to do.Reliable and secure. SanDisk is quickly becoming the gold standard for storage.A great product. Using this on my new Samsung Ativ500PC, works well with fast data transfer.  Got here quickly and includes a standard SD adapter. I ordered these cards at a great price during black friday week/weekend.  I began loading some files (music, videos, pics, etc).  The first card worked without any problems.  The second card started giving me cyclic redundancy errors.  At first, I thought it was my hard drive that was failing, and tried to copy the same files to a flash drive which worked just fine.  Ok, maybe I received a dud, and tried with another card from my purchase.  Same results, cyclic redundancy error.  I started searching online, and found a utility via one of the reviews on Amazon called H2testw.  Ran the test on both cards, and it reported errors.  It also reported write speed of only 4MB/sec, which is way below advertised speeds.  These items were in retail packaging, and I remember reading about the bulk package items being fakes.  I guess the retail package cards aren\\'t any better.I should have waited to do the refund because now I have to process the refund seperately.  I will test another card to see if I have better luck.  I wanted to leave a 1 star, but I gave 2 stars since 1 card worked so far.  I have 2 more to test.Very dissapointed because I was a fan of the Sandisk Ultra series for being reliable, but I guess they are cheaping out on quality to increase their profit.  I would have been extremely upset if I used these cards for anything important. I a using this card with a Sansa (sandisk) mp3 player and it is working flawless. I am glad, but I cannot imagine what could go wrong with a card like this, either it works or it does not, and mine is working. Anyway, I would buy one of these again without a doubt. It doesn\\'t hurt to have more memory than it does to have too little.  I have been using SanDisk brand for some time now so I can say for my self that they are pretty reliable (let\\'s just hope I didn\\'t jinx myself). It\\'s hard for me to evaluate this product in detail, but I can report that it works just in my Samsung Galaxy S5. I turned the phone off (probably much better to insert/remove cards with the phone turned off) and then slid the card into the slot inside the back of the phone. When I turned the phone back on, there was no obvious indication that I had made any changes at all. However, when I started to take photos, the camera reported that it would now be storing pictures on the card instead of the phone\\'s internal flash memory. So everything seems to work well. This product is the only one I had bought like this that has worked will recommend to all family and friends I purchased two of these for my wife\\'s and my phone. We\\'ve had no issues whatsoever with formatting and placing files onto this card. You really can\\'t go wrong with this purchase, except if the price is a bit too much. I got two of these cards for under $40/ea on small business Saturday and it was worth every penny. The card is fast, i use it in my Note 2/Galaxy S4 and i play music while taking/sending pictures constantly as well as writing s notes with no lag or stutter at all. This automatically gives you enough storage for whatever you should need, no need to ever buy a phone with the most memory because a 16gb version (or whatever the lowest version available is) can instantly have 64GB, just make sure it has expandable memory! SanDisk may have won me over since i always bought Samsung/Kingston memory, would definitely buy this again! bought it for my z10. now i have 6 seasons of tv soaps, over 1000 hi res pics, several short home vids and my entire music library with room to spare An excellent microSD card from SanDisk.  I purchased this to format FAT32 for use with mySamsung Galaxy Tab 3 (7-Inch, White)and, once so formatted, works flawlessly.  It never has \"unmounted\" on its own, it\\'s lightning fast, it\\'s reliable and offers plenty of storage.  Reasonably priced as well.  In fact, I purchased this on sale at my local big-box \"blue\" retailer with the yellow price tag for a logo for $27.99. The memory card works well in both my LG Optimus L9 (YES!!) as well as my Galaxy Note 10.1 Tablet. The card worked native on the Note but I had to reformat it to work with my phone (reformatting on the phone itself). It has the correct capacity and seems the correct speed. OK so far with my Samsung Galaxy S3. I initially received one that seemed to have an issue. It would intermittently save a photo here and there that would become corrupt a short time later. (The DropBox auto upload was fine so I know it was stored OK initially.)Amazon (excellent support) quickly shipped out a new one. The replacement has been working great so far! No sign of the issue I had with the first one.The only con is the time to display contents and read it in MTP mode if it has a lot of files.*** This is NOT the fault of the card. It\\'s a known issue with phones in MTP mode.Note to Rooted GS3 users...I also tried putting the phone in the old unmounted USB mode. I was unable to read it but was able to read a 32GB version of the same card. It appears the GS3 does not support over 32GB in the old USB mode. Possibly part of the reason why they did not include a USB option via phone settings. It worked well for me in my tablet as extra memory. I would buy again when I need more memory Works fine. Always likes sandisk products. Fits in my Samsung digital camera (takes MicroSD) fine and works great.  Fast and reliable so far. Works great with my Contour camera\\'s.  I can film 1080p/30fps mp4\\'s with no problems using these cards.  Also, the 32GB means the battery dies before the card fills up.  If you\\'re looking for a high capacity micro-SD card then look no further. I actually bought two of these items on separate orders and still using it daily with no issues. Beats the competition with quality. I wanted to upgrade my HTC Evo micro SD card. I found this SanDisk at a good price. I have had few SanDisks earlier and had no problems with it. I ordered and it was shipped fast. It comes with SD adapter and makes it usage as regular SD card. I unmounted the existing card from the phone, copied over the contents from one SD card to another using adapter and loaded up the new one. Works great. I didn\\'t see a huge difference in speed, but may be I didn\\'t run any speed tests or anything. I like the price for the brand and 32gb card. I will recommend it. It\\'s just what I needed, it works fine, and I got it around Christmas time at a great sale price. No problems and works for what it is, would buy again and recommend without any hesitations, good product. and value. Other than a few for cell phones over the years, this is the first time I\\'ve used MicroSD cards in an actual camera.  I\\'m very impressed.  It seems to be just as fast, durable, and dependable as the full sized cards that I\\'ve been using for years.  Amazing. I have a galaxy note II and after rooting I now have 64gb internal memory and this card is super fast. Can\\'t ask for any better except for larger capacity because performance is great. I\\'m running a live Linux system off of this card right now, via a USB port.  Seems to have good read/write speeds and is durable. got it for my samsung galaxy 3 comes with a free app dont need to buy a card for it tho just search sandick on play store Its a memory card that simply worked when I plugged it in. Not the fastest, but not the most expensive. Purchased this for my Galaxy Note 3 and no problems.  It was recognized without error and seems to work fine. Performance and capacity were not in line with cost and expectations. These are most likely counterfeit or back door sales in my opinion. Very unsatisfied. I bought this to go along with a nifty minidrive pro, and have not been disappointed. It really holds the full 128, and the data transfer speeds are great. I used it to keep all of the media from my itunes library, and have not had any issues with playback or lag. I really recommend this if you want to add a quick 128 to your MBP. This thing works perfectly. I\\'ve hand no problems with SanDisk and this SD card rocks. Why can\\'t they have phone with this much storage internally? I got this to upgrade my tablet to 40GB with the micro SD card. The tablet is a Ainol AX1 with 8GB of storage. I thought i needed more storage for movies. Seems to work just fine. These are excellent SD cards for phones, cameras or whatever else you have that takes a micro SD card. They work perfect with the adapter too! I use this in my Note II. I love it. I have all of my music, photos, and extras on it. This is not my first. I always try and by at least a class 10. I am not doing the test that others are. My pictures seem fast, the transfer speed is within reason. The price was just over $20 with Prime shipping. I would by it again in a heartbeat. In fact, I was probably be buying the 64 soon. I was surprised to see the main drive in my Dell Venue Pro 8 was almost completely consumed by the Windows OS.  I added this card to create some space for myself.  The tablet recognized it as an additional disc with 29GB available.  That gives me plenty of breathing room for what I do with the tablet, and the speed is incredible.  I am very pleased with this product, and will purchase another one when I upgrade the card in my GoPro this summer. Great price and works great.  If you want more storage at a  reasonable price, I would highly recommend this product. Bought this for my girlfriend.The card works very nice and is a great way to up your storage on your cell phone.this is currently in a Samsung Galaxy S4. 32GB worth of memory space, perfect if you love installing a variety of apps and it is useful when you need to store memory into your phone, camera, or tablet. This is a great card. The FPS with this card were incredible. I ended up needing more memory, so I bought the SanDisk 64 GB card. I wanted extra storage for my phone and this 16 GB is a perfect fit and the price was quite reasonable plus it comes from a quality manufacture of memory products. Works as expected, no glitches or problems. Using it with my Contour Roam2 helmet camera. Frustration free packaging was nice. All I did was install this into a Galaxy Reader gizmo, and it worked perfectly with no fuss.  I returned a different kind (also SanDisk) that didn\\'t work at all.  This is the one to get. Great MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 disk with Memory Card Adapter. great product and does with my tablet and Netbooks and Laptops.The speed of the data is good as well. I would say please get this item, and the price is good as well. Just another 16 gb micro memory card.  Quality build and on sale, the cheapest around. I got a new phone and this was part of a dock and battery deal so I pulled the trigger. So far transfers have been fast and successful. It\\'s only been a few months, but it just works. I purchased this product for my Sony Camera. Even though its micro SD it comes with a regular SD enclosure. It reads and writes fast and can hold several hundred images. Pictures were bright and sharp and download from the camera to the card very quickly. If you have a better quality camera this is a great card I have used this with a GoPro camera and a faster flash card reduces the amount of rolling shutter.I can\\'t say anything bad about it. So I got this SD specifically for my GoPro Black 3+, simply hoping it would work since the GoPro manual says &#34;use cards up to 64gb&#34; and the SanDisk says it\\'s good for cell phones and tablets, yet doesn\\'t mention the GoPro.Well, turns out it works perfect! And although I haven\\'t tried it on other devices, I think if it works flawlessly on the GoPro, it will work even better on anything else...So at first I thought maybe since it\\'s only 30mbps there may be frame rate issues with recording (even though I knew that shouldn\\'t be the case). Well after popping it in, the GoPro says 9hr14min (1080p super view video) which is insane. I put it on my helmet and took it for a spin. When I came home after spending the day on the bike, the HD quality was spectacular (granted it\\'s all thanks to the camera itself), but it was smooth, with zero frame rate issues. The only flaw is the semi long time it takes to copy files to your hard drive as it copies at only 30mbps, but honestly that\\'s really no big deal and totally worth it still.Bottom line, this SD plus the GoPro 3+ is the best camera combination for your money.P.S. It\\'s small, simple, durable, and has no lock feature (which I always found to be an annoyance anyway).Any questions please feel free to comment, and I will do my best to answer. Arrived very quickly. No issues whatsoever. Lots of storage space for music and pictures when used with a phone that is compatible. Absolutely great addition to my Note2. Provides plenty of fast storage. If you consider it, just buy it. Enough said - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !! Another necessity for the Go-Pro\\'s that I feel should at least come with the Go-Pro\\'s. At least a smaller GB to get you recording right out of the box. Too afraid to purchase an off-brand in fear of it not being compatible with the camera. While I got this card as a \"deal of the day\" on Amazon, I would gladly pay $79.99 for it!With that said, there has been some skepticism related to the serial number of the card as it is displayed on Amazon. I can confirm that I received a brand new 64 Gb card with the serial SDSDQUA-064G-U46A. The packaging of the card says that it is a Class 10 / UHS Speed Class 1. After formatting / copying over 20 Gb of data from my Evo 3D\\'s previous card, I get write speeds of about 9 Mb/s and read speeds of about 20 Mb/s. I am fine with this, and can not complain because I don\\'t believe the Evo 3D is intended to be compatible with SDXC cards, however it does work just fine. get this for my hct phone it works great . not slow like some others i have had . but i didnt know about classes  for memery cards with the othere ones . good card . done not freeze or loose anything Super Nice product at a reasonable price. I use mine in a Gopro camera and it works great. I would recommend this memory for high speed action video as it works great. Always happy with my Sandisk cards.  Used this one for my new Contour Roam.  Worked like a charm.....Awesome quality..Thanks Amazon! I would have gone for the 64gb, but they are still a little pricey. This one works fine for now. I have my entire cd music collection on the one card. Name brand, great price, great shipping Bought for GoPro but use for other HD camera also. Very dependable, have owned many without failure. Never had a SanDisk failure. This card allows the camera to work for hours and continued copies.It was one of the best purchases I have ever made. It was worth the money. I bought the 32 gb and 16 gb versions to backup photes to my Galaxy Tab 2 while travelling. It works very well an dallows me to view/edit pictures while on the road. It is my primary photo backup system while on the road. The micro SD card is much more secure and less likely to be damaged than a hard drive while travelling. I got this to use in my Acer Iconia W510-1422. When I went to format it it only shows it as a 27GB. I put it in one of my other computers to double check. YUP oddly 27GB. Fluke? Miss representing? Did I get a bad unit? Not going to return because packaging is gone and not interested in paying for the return. It works, it is fast, no issues, but only 27GB. Now my new surface tablet is complete!With all this storage I redirected my photos, music, videos and documents to save to the card. Its fast and I love keeping my internal storage available for apps only. Works on my Samsung Note 3, and for such a great price.  Fast, holds a lot of data, no need to go any where else. Excellent product for my new Galaxy S4 phone. On-board storage has now been increased 4-fold! Would definitely recommend this product. This memory card is about as fast as they come and provides easy file transfer. You are likely to need the included adapter, so it is great that it is included.Recommended Bought this for my Galaxy S4, works great but doesn\\'t support UHS1.Benchmark test:Phone- 19.4MB/s read, 9.2MB/s writeUSB 2.0- 18MB/s read, 6.3MB/s writeUSB 3.0- 30.2MB/s read, 11.3MB/s write I had this Sandisk 32Gb Class 10 micro SDHC card in a Pittasoft Blackvue DR500GW-HD in-car camera DVR. It worked like a champ for 2 months and then died with the dreaded \"Please format the SD card\" errors. Stuck it in my Mac Mini (2011) and it is unrecognizable. Same with Windows PC. Even the low level HP SD card formatter cannot reformat it. So in the garbage it goes. I have 2 more of these cards in my Garmin GPS devices and they continue to work (so far) but they are not being written to continually every day like the Blackvue. So a word of advice; if you need to write to these cards often - buy something else. I got two of these for two NOKIA 822 Smart phones. Be sure and contact your provider to find out what is the largest chip your phone can handle?  SW got this for a good price. Works great. Use it in my Droid Razr M. I store all my music and some important files on my phone with room to spare. great buy What can I say, So far it came in and works. Can\\'t complain till it fails, so only time will tell... Works with my Sansa Fuze+ to give about a million songs (okay, that\\'s a slight exaggeration), but enough songs that you can listen to songs without any repeats for about 4 days.  Speed was fine for my device, but I can\\'t speak to the camera usage.  It\\'s class 10, so it should be fast enough for video. Good price on this big micro SD card. Works with my Samsung Galaxy S5 great. Failed after a year! I simply slide the card into it\\'s slot and suddenly have 50GB more space.  I wish the OS didn\\'t consume so much of the 64GB you start out with though. I am now awaiting a replacement from Sandisk because it failed after the Amazon return period.  Always had good luck with Sandisk cards until now.  Phone and PC simply stopped seeing the card.  Lost all of my data (which i fortunately had backed up elsewhere). I have a lot of music (59 GB) and many videos and movies I like to take with me (I\\'m a video producer) so I was thrilled when I learned that the S5 would take a 128 GB chip. I\\'ve always liked SanDisk products, and this is no exception. It\\'s now at home in my S5 with about 50 GB of free space. That means I can shoot &#34;quick and dirty&#34; videos for location scouting and other purposes with the Galaxy\\'s excellent camera without worrying about running out of space. When I get back to the office, I can simply transfer the files to my computer and delete them from the card. Got it fast. Works as described . Comes with management software that must be downloaded for iTunes or google play store that links all your cloud services like drop box,sky drive, and other popular account types. Great product would and did buy again. I am using this with my Dell Venue 8 pro 64GB, and it is actually as fast as the onboard flash based ssd.  I can write to it very quickly, an di can read from it even quicker.  I recommend this if you need some additional storage space. I bought this card for increased storage on my Galaxy S3. I had zero issues using it this way. If you\\'re contemplating doing the same, ignore the theoretical limits you\\'re reading about. The 64 GB card works fine on Galaxy S3and the entirety of the card is recognized, not just the first 32 GB. Purchased this to use with our compact digital camera. This works as needed and runs quickly. As this is a class 10 it is to be expected. A great buy at a great price. shipped quickly, plug and play just like it says, and I haven\\'t noticed any bottlenecking on my phone due to slow speeds. The first one I received kept unmounting from my Samsung Galaxy S4.  It was a new phone so I wasn\\'t sure if the problem was the memory card or the phone, but I sent the card back for a replacement and the second one has worked fine.  Just under 6000 songs loaded uses just over half the space.  Love that! The price was great.  Since this is an SDXC Class 10 card,I expected pretty decent write speeds.  I copied about 30GB of data from my computer HD to this card and it took over 8 hours.Of course, since that was a one-time thing, I didn\\'t really mind.  It works great in my Microsoft Surface Pro.  I just cannot believe that I could find a 64GB micro SDXC card for under $50.  The sale is over, of course, and I\\'ve not been able to find them this cheap since.I would buy another one if it were comparably priced. Works great right out of the package, makes a great addition with the 32 GB Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet and will recommend it to anyone. Worked in my Galaxy S4, didn\\'t have to do any crazy formatting.  I popped it in and it was detected. Card works fine.  Using in a wireless IP camera that records 720p.  Can think of much else to write... it\\'s a memory card and it works :) It works as expected. What else is there to say? Plug it into my tablet in the micro slot. Slide it into the adapter and plug it into my camera. I had to use fat32format.exe in order to fully use this card in my Samsung Galaxy S3. The card comes with exFAT format, which doesn\\'t work when trying to use the card with recovery to load custom ROMs. I purchased this product knowing there might be an issue with the galaxy s4. This card worked for a week or two then began to spontaneously unmount and would mount itself back in. The unmount periods began to become longer than a few hours, days! I tried this card in a galaxy note 2 still with the same result. I attempted to contact Sandisk customer service and utilize the warranty. They know of the problem and began the exchange process then instructed me to wait for a mailing label that never came. I called back and was told that they would re-email it to me. To this day I am still waiting for that email. I have never had this issue with this company but with  ever changing technology, it is what it is, right? I know this card will be good for some device I have. If you own a galaxy phone beware!! I have not attempted to use this in a samsung tablet so on that I cannot review. The memory card works as one would expect and the adapter card worked also.  This product worked as advertized online. For some reason this card HATES my Galaxy S4. I was running around in circles for a week trying to figure out why my phone would get stuck at the Samsung screen on reboots. Finally I decided to pull the card out, and voila, phone boots up fine again. It\\'s now sitting in the ashtray in my car. When i got this memory card, noticed the writr protect lever was hard to move. Instead of just sending it back I tried to meve it and the mdmory card broke on hslt.I hanve many SNdisk cards and havd had no troible with them. I guess I just got one that missed wuslity conttol on the line.Dont want to buy another but what do you do. Once you cut and pry your way through Sandisk\\'s packaging, you will be rewarded with a nicely-made and high-performing MicroSD UHS1 flash memory.  It comes formatted to SD.org\\'s standards in FAT32, so it\\'s ready to go for most applications.  My single gripe about this product is that they have omitted the usual small plastic box that holds the card and adapter.  I use those!  Since I frequently switch cards between uses, and frequently have them in storage, those little boxes are very useful.  It\\'s way too easy to lose a MicroSD.Anyway, here are the results from ATTO disk benchmark:Settings (anticipating digicam use): Total length 64MB Overlapped I/O and QD=4 (but it never exceeds 1)Segment Size in Kbytes, Read/Write in Kbyte/secSize  Write  Read.5  9904  163431  14555  170332  13454  273244  14194  353378  15065  3985316  14154  4062932  14277  4295764  13212  44291128  17567  44247256  16209  44442512  15391  444421024  17408  444422048  16229  44442[Sorry for the ugly table, Amazon does not support consecutive spaces, including alt-255, or embedded tabs]This is very fast for a MicroSD.  It\\'s not quite up to what Sandisk achieves in full size UHS1 SD cards that can write over twice this speed, but those are electronically more complex cards. The Micro form factor likely doesn\\'t permit the additional hardware to achieve speeds comparable to the larger cards.  Note that the read speed is a lot faster than what Sandisk promises.  (Note also that you will NOT achieve these speeds with a USB2 reader.  You will need either a USB3 or built-in PCIe reader to get accurate results.  So do not complain to me if you use a USB2 reader and don\\'t achieve these speeds.)In any event, you\\'d be hard-pressed to find anything faster.My personal experience with Sandisk products is very good.  That is, I\\'ve never had anything fail on me.  Given the very reasonable prices of these, I rate them as Highly Recommended. great memory card, i bought this for my phone and it works like a gem! now im just waiting to get the new galaxy S5 and then i can pop this baby into that phone! This is going to be used in a D-Link Pan and Tilt IP Camera.  I have other devices I have tested it in and it provides exactly the service it advertises. Bought 3 for the kids tablets for christmas.  All 3 worked perectly,  I would definitely buy again if the need arises I use this in the S2, works great, movies, pictures, passworded storage areas, everything is working fine after 6 months! Your mileage may vary, good luck. working fine in Hero3 black edition. I\\'ve put several hours of shooting on the card. read speeds when dumping the card also seem good in pcie34 card reader in laptop. just wish they weren\\'t so small ! I bought this on October 9th and didn\\'t start using it for about a week after I received it on the 11th. Well two days ago it died a quick death, I can\\'t even format it! So after all these years of buying SanDisk products I guess I will give in and start paying a little more for Kingston it seems as though SanDisk is getting to be a cheaply built product. You would think that a product this small and inexpensive would be able to be replaced without cost within the first 90 days but that is my fault for not reading the fine print so lesson learned. Buy it right and buy it once so go with something else! It\\'s an SD card.  No one has the tools to test whether this is a Class 10 with speeds of blah blah blah.  It works and that is all that matters. I purchased this for my Dell Venue 11 Pro, which effectively doubled it\\'s storage capacity. Installation was simple and the card has worked flawlessly since I installed it. Great price, great performance, no headaches. Been going for a couple months now with no issues. I\\'m the owner of a bunch of SanDisk cards and have been using them for many years. This one I picked up for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and it works very well. The adapter is nice even though I have other ones. The packaging is bullet-proof. If you need a high-speed card then this SanDisk is a great choice. Good price on Amazon especially over box store prices.Highly recommended. This is an excellent storage in the minimal space. It come with the adapter, so I am able to read in the regular SD card reader also. The first unit I received had the dreaded defect where it would disconnect then reconnect which was super annoying. SanDisk has a very nice online warranty software in place and since it was a known issue they were speedy with a replacement. The new unit works perfectly and provides plenty of space. As a manufacture it was nice to be treated as I treat my customers from such a larger company. Got this for my phone and it is really great. It holds everything that I want to put on it. It holds all the stuff I want on it so I don\\'t have to put it up on cloud storage which isn\\'t always reliable. it is good memory card, it is working fine until now. i am using it in my Galaxy S3 just for storing the pictures which i take, so i do not know if it will come up with issues later on This card showed up and was formatted and recognized by my android phone with no issues at all. After doing a speed read / write test on the card, the speeds obtained were well within what a Class 10 should realistically accomplish. Great card, great price, and wasn\\'t shipped a junk card in disguise. Highly recommended. Best card for an 808 #26. Gives you 2.5 charge cycles worth of recording without having to dump memory. But ya 32gig is better! As always, this memory card just works.  I\\'ve used SanDisk products for over a dozen years and they have always worked when needed. More often, I\\'ve outgrown their capacities then worn them out.I\\'m happy so far. I\\'ve been using this in my BlackBerry Z10 for movies, music & pictures for the past few months without issue. Quick response, no lag or compatibility issues. Works great.  Plenty of storage and writes fast to my portable camera. Arrived on time. Product was packed and warped well. As the title says, the card I got is defective and faulty. The issue is, the sd card always unmounts and then remounts and sometimes it will says the the sd card is corrupted and needs to be formatted, so first I tried to format it using my cellphone (xperia play) copied all my files again to the sd card and it gave me the same error tried 2 other phones (inspire 3g and Samsung Galaxy S4) still same error, then I tried to take it out and put it in my computer and manually format AND check for bad sectors and fix errors and it will not finish and says &#34;cannot continue because sd card is corrupted&#34;.  I searched google and find out the Sandisk have shipped a bad Batch of Sd cards, so i contacted the company and demanded for a return because its past due to return it through amazon, got RMA\\'ed and already shipped it and I do not know how long will it take to for them to send me another sd card. So now I do now have any sd card to put my files because of this situations that could\\'ve avoided if Sandisk\\'s QA Department is not slacking off. Very disappointed customer. To be the man you gotta beat the man brotha. And Sandisk is beating the man wit a stick. The price the warranty they are they are letting you steal these from them. So get your hands on some before they realize they giving out the hook up and bam they $100 again.....LOLGo SanDisk go Amazon. I bought 3 and gone buy 3 more. I was a bit apprehensive about getting this SD card as I had heard that it was not compatible with my Galaxy S III.  I did see one review that said it worked just fine on his S III, so I took the gamble.  I got the SD, immediately reformatted it, which was recommended by a Galaxy representative (I do this all of the time anyway to get any &#34;bloatware&#34; off of the card!), plugged it into my phone, and it worked just fine!  I would definately recommend this SD card!! I\\'ve used SanDisk products for a long time without a problem and this is no exception. Good value, reliable, holds tons of data. What else is there to ask for? Card works great with my go pro hero , no speed issues at all. It also come with an adapter Who can\\'t use more storage? 32gb is enough to store a whole lot of music! I got it for my wife\\'s phone. I put over a dozen albums on it and didn\\'t even use a third of the space I put this into an old Samsung table that my kids use and it seems to work well. We have some videos on this card as well as a large number of apps. I have not had any problems. This is the perfect card for Your Gopro. All the speed and quality You need. And in the frustration free packaging also environmentally friendly. Data in and data out seems to be nice and fast. It was a quick ship. If I needed more I would order the SanDisk. First of all I am not sure if the product i received is a CLASS 10 memory card. The reason why i say this is that the maximum write speed i get on my WINDOWS 8 system is 1.4 MB/Sec. Also i have issues with my system recognizing the card and i do frequently receive \\'Disk Cannot Be Formatted\\' error.I am totally dissatisfied with this product considering the fact that i have a brand new laptop, Do not recommend SANDISK please check other brands. Perfect for using in my Galaxy S3.  Seems to read and write quickly, and it\\'s never given me any trouble.  Shipping was fast.  Very happy with this product. Works well working as designed... Fast and Furious. I\\'m using in my Samsung Galaxy 4S and loving it. Have music and photos on it and the access time in the photo gallery very quick. Wanted a larger faster card for my razr maxx, running on CM11/Android 4.4.  For the price this card was the best option.  My phone had no problem using it in the default exfat partition.  Is much faster than my old card.  No problems with it.  Couldn\\'t be happier. Zero complaints! Works great. My old card just quit and it seems certain cards fail on s3 and s4 devices. This one is made to work on them. Order placed and received in just over 24 hours! This works great with my GoPro Hero 3+. It is able to shoot at the 60 and 120p without any problems or delay. upgraded from a class4  to this can feel the difference on both a S2 and S3. Fast read and write speed really help when downloading large files as well from the internet with speed. Do you need memory? This is 32GB of it in a MicroSDHC package. If that is the format you need and if this is selling at a price you like, then just get it and get on with your day. You\\'ve probably got better things, like that old episode of Gunsmoke you\\'ve been meaning to get to, or a nice walk along a cliff face. Possibly even something else. The point is that memory shopping shouldn\\'t take you a long time. You should just do it. The amount of time it\\'s taken you to read this is way more time than one should ever have to invest in considering a memory purchase. Have a lovely mid-to-late-morning, whenever that might next occur in your vicinity. Cheers. Used this in an Android tablet.  It\\'s fast, reliable and performs exactly as expected. I bought this for my Galaxy S3 and it worked perfect out the box; no formatting required. It is already Fat32, Works great. Love all the extra space for storing my MP3\\'s and pictures. Needed this to be able to update my Garmin with Canada and Europe maps. Did the job and at a great price. At the time of writing this review I bought three of these memory cards in last couple of weeks, for work related phones. They work fine in the Samsung Galaxy S3 mini phones. We are happy with the read and write speeds. One small note of caution the price that can be paid for these can vary, so please check around and save a few extra dollars. When installed you will not get the full 32Gb from the SD card - but that is to be expected, so please bear this mind. Moved all my 7.9 gigs of data from one SD card to this one and now I have plenty of room/storage on my phone.  I downloaded everything to my PC from my 8gig SD card, installed this one and then re-loaded my data to this 32gig SD card.  No complaints. Stopped working after a year and a half and lost a bunch of data. I have tried accessing the data useing multiple devices with no luck. Look elsewhere for an Micro SD card Pros:1. ordered it and got free shipping.2. got it in 3 days.3. popped it out of the box.4. popped it in the cellphone!5. Done!Cons:1. doesn\\'t come with a hot pocket.2. Amazon won\\'t marry me.3. took me too long to order the hell was I thinking.4. took too long to get it out of the box 1 second!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------update:Okay  I have to bring this rating down to 1 star.... My 64gb SD card just crapped out. I\\'m getting the \"0x80071ac3\" code and i cant format it or copy files to it. I ran scan disk and nothing works... I don\\'t know if i will be buying any more SD cards again from them. luckily i was able to save all my files. I\\'ve goggled this problem and this is a common problem with these cards... While out and about in a photo shoot I had this card fail on me. Luckily I\\'m a backup freak and was just starting out for the day so I only lost a few pictures. Card completely died and had to be sent back to Sandisk for a replacement.The whole process took a little over a week and communication was excellent so 5 stars on sandisk support.I know about memory so I always have multiple cards available and if I\\'m out for an extended time, spread my work out over cards to minimize risk.What about the average person who throws all their data on this disk and looses precious memories. Sure  they are at fault for not backing up their data. Unless you are shooting HD videos though, chances are you\\'re not going to fill this card up in a day.Unless you either need the storage for HD video or something or your data is not important I\\'d say it makes more sense to just get several  16GB cards equaling 64GB at roughly the same or less price depending on brand.Again Sandisk support was great and they even asked if I needed data retrieved. I can\\'t recommend this card though. Good price. Works as expected. Nothing much more to say abt a MicroSD card honestly. The frustration free packaging is really good. Definitely better than the retail packaging. I hope you have better luck, it has gotten a lot of great reviews, but first the sticker(!) covering the contacts on the back fell off, then the card died completely. Hopefully it\\'s an isolated incident, but I\\'m trying a different brand in case its a bad batch. I now have a 76 GB tablet, thanks to this reasonably priced micro SD card and EaseUS Partition Master.  As the description says, it comes with an adapter to normal SD size.  Just put the micro card into the adapter, put the SD card into the SD slot on your computer, launch EaseUS Partition Master (free), and right click and choose partition format.  After that was completed, I put it in my tablet, and it showed almost 60 GB free.  Together with the 16 GB that came on my tablet, I am extremely pleased.  As always, Amazon delivery was fast, and I couldn\\'t be more pleased. I have been using it for over a month now, works well with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. Excellent speed, Do recommend it. I switched off unlimited data for Verizon so I wanted to get something that\\'ll store all my mp3s on my phone easily so when I\\'m out and about I don\\'t use my data to stream it.This card was great, I put it in my phone, went to phone settings to format microsd and connected it to my pc and loaded all my songs to the SD card with plenty of room left over. As soon as I got the card, I popped it into my phone and starting piling my music onto it, but then I noticed... 900 kb/s transfer speed?! I thought I got a class 10! Turns out, the device the card is mounted in has a factor on write speed. I plugged the card into the included SD card adapter and used a different reader and it was capping at 6 MB/s, so I\\'m pretty happy.One thing though; you don\\'t get 32GB of usable space with this card, or any other card for that matter! You get around 29GB with this card in particular. It\\'s normal, don\\'t worry. This card works very well with my dashcam so far and I have no reason to expect it won\\'t continue to do so. Card works fine with no hiccups or issues. Speed of card is fine with the dash camera and download to laptop. The Size of a Finger Nail ! The little too easy to lose 64GB Card Plugged in so Easy ! So Quick ! In the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 ! With Out the Adapter ! Did it Help ? Still Too New at This ! Only Required 32GB ! Overkill ? Price too Close not to get IT ! Hope that it Helps ! Galaxy Note Phone is supposed to use IT ! Thanks Amazon ! Oh ! This is so Tiny ! Keep it in the Package ! Until You Need IT ! And Keep that Package some place where it can\\'t be LOST ! IT is just Too Cute ! Thanks Again ! Cute ! Cute ! Cute ! Works perfect in my Galaxy Tab 4 This 64 gig unit lets me record hours of video in my GoPro Hero3. No need to carry extra memory cards with this unit for my website [...] No problem so far. Its fast and reliable. Working without glitch for 9 months. Uses 5gb out of 64 gb memory for internal use, so 59 gb is available. But thats good enough for heavy storage. Reasonably priced recommended for samsung galaxy s3. I bough this to replace an old 1gb card I had in my phone. I am using this in a Nokia Lumia 822 and it works perfectly. its so much faster than normal sd\\'s. I recommend this micro SD. it flies!the card reader was ok, tested it and worked but never really used it because its too big I\\'ve purchased 3 of the 32gb cards now. One each for my Galaxy S3 and my wife\\'s. Also one for her Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.The cards are super fast and there have been no problems. The one in my S3 has been in it since they came out last year no issues at all.I purchased a 16gb for our Roku2.You can\\'t beat the quality and price. Great price for a great product works great in my new Samsung Galaxy 4 why anyone [pays full price at the cell provider is beyond me! Keep up the good work Amazon love you guys!! great memory card.  i have trusted sandisk since it came out with memory products.  they work harder to keep innovating. It\\'s a Micro SD card, it\\'s 128 GB (which is amazing), and that\\'s just about all I can say...  I do wish it was faster, because I\\'ve put 20-40GB virtual machine files on it and it took quite a while for them to copy.  I guess I\\'m used to SSD speeds.  But anyway, it adds a much-needed additional storage to my tablet. this is my 10th SDHC card.  I bought Sandisk only. good quality, good brand. recommend to friends. used in Galaxy Note 10.1 Is there any more I can say? No! I get it less than 30 bucks! You can use it in your cellphone or whatever support it. Love the storage space.  My GS4 only has 16 Gigabytes for storage and fills quickly.  I just store all my media on the memory card now instead of on the internal memory. Transfers go quick thanks to the great write speeds. Works great, my phone detected and let me format it to FAT32 with no additional tools. Once formatted its 59GB (you lose some in the conversion metric from GiB to GB. Bought it for my Motorola Droid X first generation phone, I wanted to use it as a media player and it works wonderfully and has lots of storage for my movies, music, games and books. Its a class 10 card so its also very fast, certainly faster than the stock card. Great but i still dont know how to use it to store my apps on the surface, the only reason why i bought this thing Runs all the features of GoPro black edition seamlessly!  Very cool, great speed, good look, would buy again!  Need a memory card buy this I was having problems on my gopro videos being choppy and cutting out. this card fixed it all its fast enough and does the trick I tried to read some articles and reviews on cards, when wanting to store music on my phone for the Amazon MP3 app. I found it to be a bit confusing and in the end took a chance and just ordered this one. I couldn\\'t be happier with it. I found an app that automatically moves my Amazon MP3 downloads to the card and I\\'m able to store a ton of music on the phone, saving me from having to stream it and jeopardize my 2GB Verizon limit. This was a painless install that I should have done a lot sooner. I have had this micro-SDHC card for about 4 months now and I have had no problems with it. I had previously been using a similar 32 GB card in my HTC Evo, but upgraded to 64 GB when I got the Samsung Galaxy S4. I\\'ve noticed no issues with speed or reliability. This card is used for my Samsung Galaxy S3 on AT&T and it works great!  Read and write speeds are pretty good, and the card installed and was recognized by the phone very easily.  Great option if you need more storage on your mobile device! what\\'s not to like, works with my Nexus.  speed and capacity are fine.  no problems.  good quality and I\\'d recommend Works as intended. I use it with my old Sansa MP3 player,and I have another one which is used with my Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 android tablet and they both work fine on both devices after being formatted by the android tablet. I\\'m planning to buy more now since I\\'m an anime junkie,and anime junkies need their space lol Maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time, but to me it seems that the 64GB SD cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called \"exFAT32\" instead of the standard FAT32 to get 64GB from a 32GB card.  After receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with, Jelly Bean, it was recognized and it did show I had 59GB available.  I then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers, a Win7 and a Vista, and tried to transfer files, photos and videos from my laptop to the card they WOULD NOT TRANSFER!  After some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new \"exFAT32\" to the standard FAT32.  All my files were created in Win XP and Win Vista - FAT32.  I also have a Win7 machine I recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exFAT32.  I had read on the internet about reformatting  the cards and it working.  My Win7 machine does not even have the option to format to standard FAT32, it only has NSTF and exFAT32.  My older computers have the older FAT32 format option and it took my Vista computer with a Dual Core processor 1  hours to reformat the card to FAT32.  After reformatting I was able to easily transfer my files, photos, and videos on my XP and Vista computers BUT not the Win7 computer.  The card works in my tablet and I am able to access and use all the files I transferred to the card in FAT32 with my Vista computer on the tablet.  BUT after reformatting it now the card only has 27GB of space available, so it was essentially reformatted the 64GB card into a 32GB card.  I will keep the card because I have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future I can reformat it again back to exFAT32 if and when exFAT32 catches on and an OS is made that can seamlessly use files created in both FAT32 and exFAT32.  This seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big GB card that can be used for everything in every device, unless ALL your files, photos, and videos are in, or will be created with, exFAT32 there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower GB cards if you really need this much storage space in a Micro SD card.  Or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exFAT32 and double the capacity if your computer has the exFAT32 reformat option.  I have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exFAT32 works for you. I gave 3 stars because it does work, but I feel Sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting 64GB out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising. My wife just loves taking pictures on her Galaxy S4 and was filling up the internal memory. Popped this baby in and now she has tons more room. Always a good idea to keep your pics on an external just in case the phone crashes that your pictures are saved.. Too bad apple doesn\\'t offer that feature... Bought 2 for me and my wife Samsung Galaxy S2 phones.  Took photos and video and there is no issues at all.  Based on my previous experience on similar products I got for DSLR and other cameras,  this thing should last as long as or longer than all my electronics. Use with my GoPro Hero 3 & class 10 is a must.  These are inexpensive & simply get the job done!  I own 3 & am considering purchasing 1 or 2 more.... These cards never let you down.  They are priced well and always perform.  I don\\'t really like micro SD because they are so small, but all the new devices are using them so I have to adapt It\\'s pretty much a commodity product made in the Far East, but what I store on it is pretty valuable.  I feel confident in SanDisk manufacturing quality control, in the end. I added this SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC to my smartphone, and it works perfectly.  Although I would not say that I &#34;love&#34; the memory card, I will say that I have no complaints about it, and I am perfectly happy with it. Found this card at a reasonable price on Amazon and purchased to replace a several-year-old 16G no-name card that passed away. Have no issues so far and being a SanDisc expect many years of use in my smartphone. 32G size allows for plenty of media space without clogging up phone\\'s internal memory. I bought this card excited to expand the 16GB of storage that come with the phone.  However, this card had issues mounting when I would start the phone.  After some research, it looks like SanDisk had a large batch of bad cards.  If formatted as FAT32 the issue rarely occurred.  But when formatted as exFAT, like is ideal for mobile devices, it would happen every time the phone was reset.  Take caution with these cards.  The bad batch should be over, I have read, but if looking to use in a Samsung phone, maybe considering buying a different type of card, as this is the only brand I have seen with issues.  Other than that, it is a good card with great size. Purchased this to expand the memory of my unit and it is operating just the way I needed it to work. I bought 4 of these for my kids Samsung Galaxy Players.  They perform perfectly and seem to have great transfer rates. Best disk I have tried thus far for my gopro black. No problems what so ever in the snow or while in the extreme heat whit plenty of room for storage. Love it, use it to store videos and photos on a Galaxy S3. Good stuff no problems yet like with my bootleg Transcend card. I used it for my Galaxy Note 3. It works fine, no lags no problems. Data transfer is good. Thanks I use this memory card with my GoPro Hero 3 Silver Camera. I have had no issues recording 1080p video with this memory card. It provides sufficient write speeds. I bought the 16gb version. I wish I would have bought the 32gb version as 1080p videos become large files quite fast. Worked fine for a month and then after about a month, the phone didn\\'t see the card any more. Tried to read it on several PC\\'s and none of them detected the card. Unfortunately it hadn\\'t been backed up so all pictures and videos take on the phone are now gone. I own the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 smartphone- and besides having a user-replaceable battery, this device also allows the user to pop in a Micro SD card.  More is better, too much is almost enough... and hence the 64-GB model, which permits storing insane numbers of songs on your phone-- in my case, over 7000!  (Three of the songs are great, 2 are OK, and the rest?  Not so good!)  Seriously- this is a \\'must own\\' if your smart phone is not made by Apple!  If you own the iPhone, not so great, there are no user-accessible batteries or Micro SD cards in iPhones.  If you own Android- well, life will be considerably brighter once you pop this in, which took all of like 30 seconds.  You do not need to format it unless you wish to erase what you\\'ve already put on it.  Highly recommend - SanDisk is a trusted provider of flash memory devices, and buying from Amazon.com is a no-brainer. Very, very good and reliable.  Use it in my Win8 tablet, so I don\\'t take it out a lot, but when I do, it seems to work fine in other places.  I bought it a while ago, and it\\'s never failed.  I would recommend it. I bought this for my Samsung galaxy s4. I don\\'t know if it is my phone or the card but my phone says it was unexpectedly removed from time to time. My wife\\'s phone doesn\\'t do it as often but still does it. Very fast but unreliable. I have had many sandisk before and this is the only one I have had problems with. I have read that there were some that were poorly made. Thinking I will send it back and give it another chance. I bought this for my GoPro Hero 3 Silver Edition. Works like a champ. Havnt had any issues. Definitly would purchase again. Simply put, this little micro works great. I plugged it into my Lumia 2520 and it was immediately recognized. The speed of getting files to and from it seems good. The price is great and I have always been a fan of the SanDisk brand. If it does fail in the next couple years (which I doubt) I will update the review but as of now the device is exactly as advertised. Picked up a couple of these to put in the Nabi2 Android tablets.  They work just fine expanding the memory to store movies.  Haven\\'t had any hiccups at all. Bought this for Galaxy S3, worked like a charm for 3 months & then I started getting error messages on phone stating the card has been taken out or that it is not there, went on like this for a week or so & then one day gone. Initially I thought it was problem with phone. Popped in a 2Gb card from BB & it worked. Popped this one into the BB & same, no detection. After spending so much on an SD card its disappointing to see it go bust outside of return period. Its great for using on my camera and speed is pretty good so cant complain. I just think the price could be little bit more cheaper since there are a lot of generic versions out there !! I put it in my Samsung galaxy note 2 phone and have no idea how ill possibly fill it up Just what we needed to replace the memory card in my phone.  This is a dependable brand and a reasonable price Used for a digital camera card.Read speeds tested acceptable on a laptop using the adapter (11mb/s)WRITE speeds were atrocious reading 1mb/s to 512kb/s.The write speeds are not good for a card that needs to write files such as pictures or hd video.I have taken a few photos and tested the video, Perhaps the camera is capable of using this card at a better rated speed than the laptop and adapter My cell phone claims up to 16GB with a removable SDHC memory card, but when I bought this, it was a big gamble. I honestly didn\\'t think it would work, being 4 times the rated capability, but it did and does. I have used it in 2 different phones, HTC and LG cell phones as well as my PC. Since it works very well in my cell phones, I expect it will work just as well in a tablet. Very happy with this purchase. I trust the San Disk name and have no issues.  For a phone, Class 10 is a must.  Good price for this product. Works fine with photo shooting and video recording in EOS camera with the SD adapter. Perfect for tablet and phone memory. I highly recommend this SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC card because :(1)Class 10 is the highest speed you can get. Allows you to take photos faster and to capture high definition videos. Allows faster reading, writing and transferring of files to computer.(2)I encounter no problems in using it in voice recorder, camera, video recorder, computer etc.(3)Price charged by Amazon is much less than 8 other sellers that I have checked.(4)Lifetime warranty.(5)Free download of RecoveRx software which brings lost photos back.(6)Free adapterPrecautions :-------------Get rid of static electric charges by touching your fingers on bare, unpainted metal.Do not touch the metal contacts of the card with your fingers. The circuits inside the card are very low voltage and are easily damaged by static electric charges which usually have much higher voltages.It takes time to research these information. Please click \"Yes\" below this line if this review was helpful to you. i bought this for my go pro and it works great. i can record 9 hours of video now. thats pretty sweat compared to 2 gb 19 minute videos. Added this to my Microsoft Surface RT tablet and it works perfectly and is extremely fast. Perfect for storing videos! Wanted to test some things on an old Android phone. This worked perfectly. Don\\'t use the phone any more so will now use it for my camera. We\\'ll see. While all Sandisks products are excellent, this is apex.  However, use some caution....not every smartphone, tablet, camera or other digital appliance can or will accommodate the capacity or speed of this product....just make sure yours does, and if it does have no regrets....you\\'re using the best....then watch how well that phone, tablet or camera performs! Altough Motorola says the Droid Razr Maxx only supports a 32gb card, I\\'ve read many reports of people using this 64gb card, so I took a chance with it.I formatted it in my phone and started loading music and movies onto the card by connecting my phone to the computer with the USB cable.Note:  I had read to NOT format the card in the computer because it will only show up as  27gb of memory available - I was careful to heed this advice, though did play with it in the computer itself (without formatting it, just looking) and it does only show up as 27gb . However, in my Droid it definitely shows as 64gb (well 59 and change)So far the card is functioning as it should: I have  played music, looked at pictures, and watched a little bit of a movie, all stored on the card, and eveerything seems to be working iin blissful Droid perfection. Made a very nice upgrade for my Droid RAZR Maxx, replacing the stock 16GB Class 4 card.  My transfer speeds have improved (though not hugely), and the extra space has made a huge difference.  With a name like SanDisk, I don\\'t worry much about quality or reliability. It\\'s a microSD chip. It\\'s the storage amount I specified. It\\'s sitting in the back of my Samsung Galaxy S3. It\\'s nothing more than exactly what I asked for. Bought this for my son\\'s tablet (asus prime) and it works great.  We were able to load his music, movies, and a few apps and haven\\'t noticed any lag time as we have in the past with other cards.  Would definitely purchase more. Sometimes when the price is too low you get less than you paid for. My suspicions were deepened when the package arrived with generic packaging, not the brand label of &#34;SanDisk Ultra.&#34; Nevertheless, I am satisfied with the product. It works fine. Sure beats the price Walmart was charging for a 64 GB micro SD card. I wanted a 64GB card for my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  I\\'ve learned my lesson about buying from that well-known auction site we all know, and getting fake cards there.  I\\'ve always had good experiences buying memory cards from Amazon, and always got genuine stuff.  This card was recognized by my phone right away, mounted, and formatted perfectly.  I have a ton of music on it, and some videos, and still have about 12 GB free.  I feel like I got my money\\'s worth! It is whats it is. It does it very well. No hiccups with this disk so far. HD recording works well. I went from 2g to this 32g card and really love it. The price is WAY lower than the Verizon stores. You will NOT have storage issues after popping this in your phone. With an 8oo dollar phone, I want as most as I can get, and this mem card was the way to go. And does what is says it will. What else can really be said about memory cards?? They either work or not. This sd card arrived quickly and did the job in my phone. I was having strange issues with my phone and some error messages with my card, that reformatting couldn\\'t fix. This did the job! I have had great, reliable success with sandisk and will continue to use them. works great! what else can i say? YOu can\\'t go wrong on this card.  For my ROKU 2 XS, this is the perfect size.  Probably over-kill actually.  But i won\\'t do anything under Class 10 and i try to avoid anything under 16 gigs in case i need this card for something else. Price was great too, under $15 with free shipping. I got this microSD card to use in my new Asus tablet.  It works great.  I also wanted it to use in my camera as its SD card.  Fitted into the SD card adapter and it works perfectly in the camera.  Pull it out and put it into the tablet slot and I can get my pictures off the card as well as use it for some other things.  Perfect. Used it in several camera models (D800, Nex-5N and HDR-AS15) all worked great with no issues. I am definitely thinking about getting a few more of these since Amazon has an unbeatable price. I bought his card in November 2012 and it just died. Fortunately, I had backed up the files but for what I paid, I am dissappointed. No more SanDisk products for me.Update: I realized that the reason this wasn\\'t working was because I had an AOSP rom on my Note 2. When I went back to Touch Wiz, it could be recognized again. I\\'ve changed my rating from 1 to 5 stars; it is working great. I quadrupled the memory in my Windows Surface with a tiny push of the Memory card into the allotted slot. Way to go SanDisk. Okay, there are tons of these cards available.  Why did I pick this one?  Because it IS NOT all black!  when I have to switch out cards in my devices, it\\'s easy to drop or misplace these tiny cards.  Having one that is not all black makes it easier to track.  Works well, no complaints, good price. Can\\'t go wrong with this item.  Have purchased none other than SanDisk for use with my dash camera. I have this installed in my Verizon Rezound Android phone and it works perfect. Many phones advertise they support up to 32Gb of memory when in reality, they will work with 64Gb too. Well, it is pretty much as advertised. Good speeds. I think it formatted somewhere around 62 gigs.This was a great buy. Fast & flawless.  And the price has finally reached a level where there\\'s no excuse for less memory in my devices. Its just amazing the amount of storage you can get in the size of a pinky nail.  I have this mounted to my phone filled with music, documents, pictures and all of my mobile phone records and messages from the past 3 phones.  Still have plenty of room left and no issues. The memory card worked perfectly, and was compatible with Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, and was a great price for a name brand memory. Use it in my digital camera. I have a Nikon L100 and used to use a class 4 card. Burst mode can capture 8 photos but it would take almost a minute to save m to the card. Now, its a matter of seconds. Love this card. Seriously, these are the best ones to get for the price. If you pay over 28 dollars for these somewhere else, don\\'t. Perfect for any phone or Cameras or there. It\\'s high class and the gb\\'s is plenty for any average user. In fact I\\'m a heavy use of data and I never use more than 32gb. If I do i know where to get more =] I have one in 3 phones, 2 Samsung Galaxy Players (my kids) and 2 Tablets.  Can\\'t go wrong with SanDisk - they\\'ve never failed me. Okay not limitless but close enough. I have this in a 32GB phone and combined, that\\'s quite a bit of available storage. I have tons of photos, music, and entire seasons of TV shows.It\\'s great to never get a warning about having low storage. I can take the max resolution photo option with my phone and shoot 4k videos without having to worry about running out of space.It\\'s also speedy at transferring files to and from my laptop. Be sure you\\'ve updated your drivers.  One of my laptops said this was only 32GB, but I updated the drivers for my card reader and it -then- showed up as 64GB SDXC.Works in Acer Iconia A700 -after- formatting as FAT32.  You can\\'t do that natively in Windows, but there are tools out there that work.Great item, great price, and arrived three days BEFORE anything else I ordered on the same day.  Great seller. Works great in my Samsung phone. Fast Enough to not really notice it is here.Came with an app that  shows disk usage both on card and internally, as well as Drop Box. Slightly useful.===Update: 1 year later it\\'s become completely unreadable by any device. I was about to throw it out until I noticed that the warranty on this is pretty good. Contacted SanDisk, sent the old one back, and received a new card in a week. Bugs me that it stopped working -- it went from working to completely unfunctional in about 2 days. During that time the devices were complaining about corruption every couple of times. Very nice upgrade for my phone, gives it plenty of space for allot of games. and if you wondering yes this is compatible with a Samsung galaxy s4. My Surface\\'s disk space was very limited until I popped this in. It is a wonderful solution to the 64GB Surface Pros and with Windows 8.1 we will have even more flexibility when interacting with SDXC cards. The pictures and videos load just as fast as if they were on the native hard drive. Just what I needed for my new TAB 4. I have absolutely ZERO issues with it in my Samsung TAB. Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  I started having all kinds of issues with recording photos and movies to the card.  It would look like it worked and then when I\\'d go back to review the photos or movies they were corrupted.  I see other people having the same issue with these cards.  Lost memories - bad card... I am only giving this product 3 stars becuse I purchased this one as a replacement for a SanDisk micro SD card that kept having problems with.  I finally got tired of losing my data and ponied up the $20 odd dollars to just replace the darn thing. Okay, I\\'m a memory hog. I admit it.The Note 3 has 32GB internal storage and it\\'s nearly full. I had a 64GB microSD card in it and guess what? 15GB left! So what\\'s a geek to do?Buy THIS! Wow, what breathing room I have! And then some! I copied the entire 64GB card to the 128GB card, and then added more HD movies. In addition to the phone\\'s stuff, I have all 6 Star Wars movies, the Back to the Future trilogy, and the Indiana Jones movies on this card and room for plenty more. No doubt when the Note 4 comes out, I\\'ll be ready with a kick-butt memory card.The Note 3\\'s specs state that it will accept cards \"up to 64GB\". Well, at the time 64 was the highest card available, so they couldn\\'t possibly test for a higher capacity. Phandroid / Android Forums, however, has a fairly comprehensive list of devices that are compatible with this card, accurate to the date of the article:[...]So I\\'m a happy camper. Yes, I paid a premium for being an early adopter... but I\\'ll be saving my pennies for the inevitable Black Friday sale in November, which will be just about the time the Note 4 is released. Folks, I can\\'t recommend this card enough: just make SURE you\\'re backing up to a PC regularly! If it does fail, you definitely want your precious pics and data backed up. Works but there is a trick to it. So I purchase a Lenovo Yoga 10 tablet and installed the card and it told me the card was damaged, I put the card in my PC and it worked fine, I even reformatted it in the PC, still no luck. Called Lenovo and they walked me through formatting it again in the PC and still didn\\'t work BUT there was an option in the Android software that is a status screen (pull down from the top of the screen) and that gave me a choice to let me format it in the tablet and after it completed it I was good to go, it mounted and I downloaded my 318 songs on it and it is working like a charm. Only thing I can think of is that Android doesn\\'t like the way SanDisk formats their cards. I think if everyone knew about this there would be a lot less returns. This product was formatted and installed in a GoPro Hero 3 Black. I get 4:30 hours of recording time on 1080p 60fps. No issues so far and don\\'t expect any since SanDisk is basically the standard for solid state memory. Put it in my Galaxy Note 2 and my Galaxy note 10.1 and it reads and writes perfectly. Will buy another Works great. My phone is happy. I\\'m happy because I can put more music and pictures on it.  The price was perfect. Bought this for my HTC Evo 4G LTE, it works great, I knew in order to use such a big card it had to be a Class 10, and I only trust SanDisk, Samsung, or Kingston with my memory cards. This one works well, it did take about a day for the &#34;bugs&#34; to be ironed out and let the Evo find its paths back to its files. This is a very good stick at a very good price. The first one I got from Amazon was damaged, they quickly replaced it..... with one that was lost by FedEx!!!! I called up about a week later and they overnighted a new one, and paid for weekend UPS delivery! I was amazed at the service from Amazon on this.All-in-all, it doesn\\'t get much better than SanDisk for memory, and Amazon for the place of purchase. Don\\'t hesitate to buy this card for your HIGH END phone. I know for a fact that the HTC Evo LTE & Galaxy S3 can run this card. I have not had many problems with what I have bought over the years, but when I do I will make sure to warn others. I loaded a handful of videos from my PC and then installed this in my Android tablet for a trip. Corrupted. Nothing worked and sometimes it can be seen, other times it doesn\\'t even show up. The tablet wants to format it, which it has never been able to do successfully, and needless to say it is too small to even be a paperweight. The SD adapter that it came with was also junk and upon the first time I went to use it, it simply didn\\'t feel right--- so I used my trusty Lexar micro SD to USB that came with my Lexar 32gb micro SD card.I would have expected more and unfortunately as it stands many people have success with them working and equally those that do not. I have even formatted it to see if it made any difference and there was none. And of course my window of return is gone so unless the seller stands behind it--- it is going in the trash. I knew I should have gone with what I had purchased before as I have three of them working perfectly for over a year. Moreover what is even a bigger disappointment is that our camera that uses a standard SD card and it is a no-name with no identifying marks---- has worked for two years without a problem.I do know problems arise, but..... when the cost of a product goes up and up and the quality control goes down--- I am not going to be the one accepting those terms. If you\\'re looking for a good card, search Amazon for this one: LSDMI32GBSBNAR. This is the Lexar and I have thousands of pictures, video clips, and it has even endured three updates to my phone--- plus I carry my phone everyday so it is subject to everyday life all the time, it has been tough stuff. I had no problems installing this into my phone.  The phone picked it up automatically and worked great.  It fit perfectly into Sim slot. What can I say, it\\'s a memory card. Good price for a nice performing card - I\\'d definitely buy again. This product sucks.  My phone keeps giving me a \"card removed\" please re-insert or something like that! Only to find out that they do have that problem (32gb sd\\'s and higher micro sd card ultra class 10).  Complained to company and it\\'s taking forever for them to ship me a new one.  Many mistakes happened with my new items and inconvenient.  Better to have just returned it with \"Amazon\" got the money back and bought a different one!!!  Company sucks! you would think Sandisk is a reputable name but \":$)($)(*. I bought 2 cards from them 32g and 64g and both have problems. this little card is great for all kinds of use, with quick write times and plenty of space. works like a dream in my phone. Not much more to say, I\\'ve tried many and these are the very best (speed, price, reliability, compatibility.)  I highly recommend these cards. Perfect and just what I needed for my GoPro camera.  It also comes with an adapter car which can be handy. used for my phone to upgrade the storage, and works great. transfer speeds are faster than the network  can provide it with. Just what the doctor ordered for my Galaxy Tab 3 Tablet... Now there\\'s plently of room left over for everything... Seemed to work well at first.  Then, I noticed the phone started mounting/unmounting the card. When I tried to update some music files on the card, I think it has failed.  My computer can no longer see it in the phone when the two are connected.Okay - an update here. Since I posted the problem on Amazon I was contacted by Sandisk. I made one phone call, they took my information, e-mailed me a pre-paid UPS label, and I sent the card in. I couldn\\'t believe it, but I think I had a new and improved card in about three days!  Yes, the first one lasted a little over twelve months, but the replacement was tendered no questions asked. Great service that can only be five stars.By the way, the replacement is working great!  I ordered a 64gb Sandisk microSDHC Card as well! You can\\'t go wrong with Sandisk and you can\\'t go wrong with Maximum space!I love movies, so space is important. I\\'ve been a sandisk user for years and never developed a problem with a disk.  Amazing how much these little disk can hold! Always have multiple shots at your dataI lost some photos due to a corrupt cardI used this for my phoneThe company did replace my card with no problemsBeen working great for the past few months Works great in my Samsung S4 phone. Being class ten it is designed to write quickly, but somehow my phone\\'s internal storage is faster: minus one star.I have been using this for about a month with zero data loss or other problems. You will notice that your camera, phone will work a lot faster.  I was really surprised to see how much better all worked with this Chip.  You will be very happy. If you need anything else out of it, I\\'m not sure what to tell you.  Transfer speeds are quick from the phone over usb to the computer. 128GB in the size of a fingernail for this price, who\\'da thunk it?Works fine in my Sansa Clip Zip (using Rockbox software - probably fine with original firmware but I haven\\'t tried it).NOTA BENE: As with all SDHC/XC cards, it comes from the factory formatted to ExFAT.For Rockbox at least, and probably other software, reformatting to FAT32 is required.If your device or software supports ExFAT, you won\\'t care about this caveat.I\\'m only using it for MP3 bitrates, so I can\\'t comment on speed issues.The dark red printing on the card is hard to read compared to the white on the 64GB cards.AWESOME!  Thank you Sandisk and Amazon. Has held data and transferred with my PC seamlessly.  So far no problems with corruption in 6 months.  Apps move from the phone to SD card very quickly. Works great in our Nikon D600.  We\\'ll NEVER run out of space between downloads :-) This card worked well with my last two smart phones and holds all my favorite music with enough extra storage for photos. Needed a large size micro SD for my new phone (I have a very large music collection as well as large photo collection. I was thrilled to find this large of a micro SD. No worrying about how large a file could be, no worrying about taking videos, or snapping a few extra photos! First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail. If all those are a yes for me then I will give it 5 stars. I am not just rating it 5 stars cause its the best product of its class, that is for each person to decide. I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.I have has a SanDisk SD card for 2 years with my phone and it has lasted through the tough times and high heat. I bought this to add movies to my daugther\\'s Galaxy Note 2 10.1 tablet, No changes are needed to format it just plug and play. Buy this product with any of the new Samsung tablets or Note 2 and it will just work :) Has anyone ever had a DOA? The only chips I have ever lost were after some use, but SanDisk is a good brand Works great.  Great for video capture since it is a class 10 rating.  Works as it should and the shipping was fast as well. I got several of these for my tablet.. So far I am very happy.. Actually I have one in my phone, one in my tablet, and one as a backup for traveling.. So far they have been great for me... love it and love sandiski have had a SD fail and they replaced it. so i felt no reservations about buying this over another brand and have had no problems. BEST PRICE DEAL FOR ME GETTING A GOOD NAME BRAND.  HAVE NOT ACTUALLY USED THE STORAGE TO DATE.  GLAD TO HAVE THE STORAGE. We all know these are the best in the industry - very quick transfers and very nice results from these micro\\'s. Worked once I was able to find a system to format it.Second card from SanDisk that was sent to me unformatted.They need to get their act together... Have saved all the tablets photos, free apps and oodles of other stuff.  I don\\'t see any way to ever use all of the memory. You may  think that it is not worth spending the extra few bucks for this version of micro SD but trust me it is this transferred about 8 gbs of music in 10 minutes with the original  version it took about 25 minutes on the same computer. So it is definitely worth the extra few bucks. it does what it is supposed to do it fits in my Mom\\'s camera holds lots of pictures easily slides in and out of the slot so far no problems What\\'s to be expected What can I say that hasn\\'t said already for this product, very fast delivery, excellent packaging, right price and it works perfect with my Samsung Galaxy SII.Looking forward to buy a 64GB for my new S4 I ordered this before Amazon fixed their price and it cost $199 USD. The product is great however it is over priced at $199. I think their 128gb Thumb drives go for about $79 USB and were on sale at brick and mortar stores for $69 last week.This is a product that should have been released at least 24 months ago and Sandisk is a company that likes to drag its feet and squeeze people with older cards like the 64gb cards.All I can say is where are the 256gb, 512gb, 1TB and 2TB Micro SDXC UHS-I or UHS-II cards? (They all use the ex-fat file system) I have tested my GS3, GS4, Note 3 and Note Pro 12.2 with this card and all of them read it just fine. This allows recording at the highest quality in my Canon camcorder whereas many others will not allow high quality recordings Storage prices will always go down (though I won\\'t say at what rate over what interval of time, a la Moore\\'s Law - I\\'m not that smart.) At the time I purchased it, it was a very good price for this amount of memory.  In a year\\'s time, it will probably be a laughably expensive sum for a pittance of storage.  Oh, well.With it in my phone, I don\\'t have to worry about the number of photos or the duration of video I take. Picked this up on sale.. doesn\\'t work, only shows up as a 1MB (yes, Megabyte) card that I can\\'d do anything with.  I already threw away the original packaging too.  I\\'m sure returning it is going to be a huge PITA because of that.UPDATE: After writing this (albeit, short) review I found this is not uncommon.  I also found that this card was deliberately crippled despite the product description saying \"The SanDisk Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Card works with any microSDXC compatible device.\"  That was all the motivation I needed to process a return on it rather than having it replaced. I use this in my Hero3 white edition camera for FPV.  I\\'ve done about 20 videos to date, without a single problem. There is a speed penalty if exfat is used as oppose to NTFS.Using ATTO and formatted as exfat:read speed = ~45MBswrite speed = ~15MBsUsing ATTO and formatted as NTFS:read speed = ~45MBswrite speed = ~17MBsWith exfat, the write speed actually fluctuates as the transfer size increases.  But using NTFS, the speed are consistent.Tested on Lenovo T530 using built in SD card reader. Got a defective memory card.  Showed only 1 GB instead of the 64 GB.  Returned it for a replacement and never got the replacement!  Got my money back and went to Walmart. That\\'s a lot of MP3s and photos. Works 100% with no issues with my 32GB Samsung Galaxy S III phone. this is by far the very best sd i ever owned. it writes and read at crazy speeds. easy to use and connect to any device.im glad i bought it. plus is waterproof, shatterproof, freeze proof, g-force to break it is incredible. Works great, no issues. Tablet recognized it immediately and the speed is great. Lots of storage and no compatibility issues to report. I bought three of these and all three worked upon initial installation with no formatting. Using my notebook computer\\'s built in SD card reader, I saw transfer speeds between 6 Mb writing and 14 Mb reading. This was doing a simple \"copy / past\" of all files on my old card that I had saved to my computer. These speeds are much slower than the stated maximum by the card manufacturer, but would be expected with over 12,000 small files like my example. The read / write times were close to 50% faster than those of my old 8 Gb class 10 SanDisk micro SD card, so there is definitely a performance gain with this updated card.All things considered, 16 Gb of storage on a Class 10 card from the leading manufacturer, and at $15 is a steal. I highly recommend this card. I got this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone for additional storage.I originally had another card in it that was apparently not fast enough or something and gave me errors while shooting videoit would let me shoot video but not watch them backthis card fixed this problem The card works like a charm with the GoPro Hero 3.  Pay attention though... it is about the size of a fingernail and could get lost very easily.  Also, keep track of the Adapter, as you\\'ll need it to download the images. This card will hold about 3.5 hrs of hd video on the GoPro Hero3. The adapter that comes with it works great too. I bought this when it was on a special deal.  Am happy with my decision to purchase this and do recommend it. What more can I say, open the box plug it in and it works !!!! Thats all you can say about this item. Worked immediately after I inserted.29.71 GB recognized, doesn\\'t really bug me but I wish I got the full 32. This is a great price for such big storage and it\\'s does a great job with my first smart phone. The product works exactly as promised.  I installed in my Samsung Galaxy S III without any issues.  Now all of my photos, videos, and music are on it so no worries about using my main memory for those data intense items. The drawback is all the darned packaging for this tiny card. Seriously, it\\'s plug in and you\\'re done, why all the packaging?Aside from that, it\\'s working.  I\\'d buy it again. My last san disc micro card stopped working randomly, and got this one to replace it...it is perfect. Its way faster than the last one. Good price too. Has worked like an absolute charm in my PSP, and for the on going reduced price, I ended up buying a 2nd for my new Samsung Tab 3 even though I didn\\'t need the extra storage (yet). It is good, and can work well in my Canon Powershot 520, but can not be  used to make vedio in my Canon T3i. I do not know why. Bought it for my tablet.  Its worth it to pay a couple bucks more for quality instead of trying to seek out the rock bottom priced bargain sometimes.  There\\'s a lot of counterfeit cards out there but you don\\'t have to worry about being suckered like that when you buy a SanDisk or other quality name brand memory card. I always buy San Disk as I had issues with other brands and it always works in every application I used it, phone, camera, tablet, etc. Well known brand at a great price.  Works as expected for a scandisk.I would tell a friend to purchase one. For some unknown reason I could not find this locally.  I needed it for a security camera, which I suppose is an odd application for most people, but I found it on Amazon and received it quickly.  SanDisk products have worked very well for me and I now have a record of who comes and goes from my driveway on this micro disc at my disposal when I need that information. Listen - I got the SanDisk after I had a Kingston card in my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 2) and it DIED after less than a year!!! Luckily, my phone was synced to dropbox, otherwise I would\\'ve lost valuable pics including our first summer family vacation!!! So far, so good with the SanDisk. It\\'s been a few months. If there\\'s a catastrophe, I\\'ll update this review. But as of right now, it\\'s working really well. Amazing how much stuff you can save on this little card.  SanDisk has always been reliable and I would recommend it.  Amazon seems to have the best prices. I bought this for my wife when it was on sale for Black Friday 2013, and has been coming to good use since. She appreciates the fact that she has extra (other than built in storage) for her phone to be able to hog on to more pics, music, and games. Great deal on a great product. i don\\'t really know what to say - accept that it does the job - i use it with my SOny Action Cam - and so far so good - :) This was purchased on a special and the price was right!  It works great, plenty of storage space, and the great price sealed the deal! This is the card you want for a high end smartphone or camera.No trouble setting it up. Fast speeds transferring my old SDcard data back onto this one.Don\\'t hesitate, this is it. I use these in my Logitech Alert cameras which are outside in the elements. These perform better and more importantly last longer than other cards do. SanDisk is one of the top brands for removable memory. As expected, this worked right out of the package. I use it with my GPS. Works great with my dash cam. 32Gb for $20? yeah i would say this is a win! Works in my phone and digital camera as well. You can\\'t go wrong purchasing this memory card. The more memory, the more you can store. It is FAST and reliable. On my GoPro Hero3 cam, one can store up to 9 hours of video time and LOTS of images. I never keep track because I have so much space. I\\'ve been able to store many videos and images on this memory card. I highly recommend the SanDisk Ultra! Within an hour of using the memory card, it failed and died. it kept saying &#34;Memory error.&#34;I could never get my dashcam camera to record anything. I went to our walmart and got me just MicroSD not Ultra. It has been working all day so far.That\\'s right. There is no way to tell what you are getting online is OEM or knock offs. When the price is too good to be true, it probably is - made and distributed by Mofia. LOL.Although the package arrived on time, I will never buy this product online or from this seller on Amazon. Waste of money. I received this on Friday, followed the review from another person about formatting the disk before using it, and after the format, it did it\\'s thing!  I have a Motorola Droid RAZR and have seen a huge improvement.  The phone is much faster.  The apps open and close much faster.  That also goes for the camera.  I highly recommend this and worth the price.  I haven\\'t placed any music on the it yet except for pictures on my phone.  Cheers. Memory card fit my phone just fine.  More memory for more apps.  Great price as well. Item was well packaged and showed up within the time frame given. Bought it for my phone, a Samsung Galaxy SIII. Seems to work just fine. Not much else to say. It does what it is suppose to do. Beware guys. i bought one of these from Superior Electronics Outlet and it arrived completly dead. i tried to format it on windows and on my galaxy s3 and no go.I tried everything that possible ....have been fighting with this card for 3 days now, and no success so far. No response from the seller about it.My last hope is amazon refund me. otherwise  i just wasted 80 U$ Received promptly in envelope. Envelope inside which held plastic bag with clamshell. Card and adapter inside clamshell. I kept the clamshell for storage of other cards. I put this into my PALM TX PDA. YEP! Still use a PDA...works VERY well. Great price and reliable. I got 3 for my various devices and haven\\'t had any issues with them at all. My phone and music player now have an awesome amount of space. fast transfers and retrieval of data on phone, especially video shooting. very easy to find becasue of color difference, all black seems easy to misplace of trading out to adapters and such Got this for my Galaxy S4 and this thing has lived up to expectations for speed and performance.  Writes fast while taking 1080P Movies and the Burst Shot function creates many HD Pictures. This is a great little card, no problems thus far!  I load this up with movies and then watch away! This is exactly as advertised, which is better than some other memory cards and drives. If you need a 32 GB MicroSDHC card, this will definitely work. Comes with a standard SD card adapter, too. I bought this for a Galaxy Note 8.0, and while it functions properly, it is completely useless for my tablet. I can\\'t put movies or books on it, because they are streamed from Google Play, and i can\\'t put apps on it because that is not allowed. Why do they put a $&@?!$@& micro sd slot on a tablet that can\\'t use it for anything but backups- backups i might add that are already in the cloud. Amazon did a great job delivering it, which was a bright spot in the realization that i spent 25 dollars on a chip that is going to do a better job cleaning the dirt out of my grout than helping the memory on my tablet. Ordered this to put music and pictures on my Windows phone and it works perfect like every other Sandisk product I have purchased. Would purchase again if I need another one. This works well with my Samsung Galaxy Stratosphere II. It has a lot of storage space, good for all your videos, music, and pictures. It comes with an adapter so if you wanted you could use it in a spot for a regular SD card, but it really is meant for use in a voice or data recorder, a camcorder, or phone. It is class 10 so it handles recording and playback of HD quality video which is important as newer phones can record that way. Very good card I bought the SanDisk 32 Gb micro SD card (class 10) in Dec for a new Galaxy S3. I used it for songs and video and pics. It started acting flaky in April and would unmount itself and then remount and I had problems with playing music. Then it completely died and would not even reformat. This is a known issue, and I will write back after I try to get SanDisk to replace it. Almost a year with this card and no problems so far. I used first with my GN 2 and now with my Note 10 2014 edition. Fingers crossed. With so much memory used on my Galaxy s4. This allows for massive overkill on external storage.Its fast, and convenient. Monday, November 26, 2012I put this in the Galaxy S3 without formatting, restarted the phone and it showed 59.4g GB of space.  I transferred all the files from the old 16 GB card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the USB cord.  Still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music.Tuesday, November 27, 2012The card didn\\'t show up on the phone this afternoon.  No message, just no songs to play and no card according to everything I could check on the phone.  I restarted the phone and got a notification that the SD card was corrupt, needed formatting and that I would loose all data on the card.  I restarted the phone again, without formatting, and the card came up like it had never been missing.  I am writing this on Thursday, 11/29 and I have not had another issue with the card.December 6Well, I don\\'t know what to think.  The card disappeared again and I reformatted it FAT32 in an attempt to fix the problem.  The whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud.  I tried several music players and went with PowerAmp because of the good reviews and that I could specify the folder to play from.  So PowerAmp is looking for the folder /mnt/extSdCard/Music and playing the songs in all the subfolders.  It is PowerAmp that tells me that folder is not available.The card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem.Today, PowerAmp would not play and when I got home I found the Music folder was gone.  I also had Ringtones folder and it was also gone.  Now, I may not be the sharpest saw in the shed, but I know I did not delete those folders.  The card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted.I am starting to think the problem is with the Galaxy S3.  I had a 16 GB FAT32 card in this phone that had been in my previous HTC phone.  That card was not large enough to held my music so I don\\'t know if it was disappearing or not.  I wish this combination of phone and 64GB card was more reliable but just don\\'t know where the problem lies.I lowered the stars from 4 to 3 but I really don\\'t know if the problem is with the card, the phone or both.  All I know is that they do not seem to be playing well together.December 7There was a notification on the phone this morning that the SD card was corrupted and needed to be formatted.  I restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time.  I reformatted the SD card using the phone, a step I don\\'t think I have tried yet.December 8Another MINOR problem I have is that the message counter gets stuck on 1 when I have no new messages.  The only fix I have found is to restart the phone.  That happened this morning and I got the corrupted card message again, but restarted again and the card came up OK.December 11So, the files on the card keep disappearing.  The card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but PowerAmp, and file directory programs do not see any files on the card.  I restart the phone and the files come back.  Very strange.  I played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again. Restarted the phone and all is well again.December 15My phone upgraded to 4.1.1 yesterday and the same issues remain.  It is a crap shoot as to if music will play.  I take a lot of photos and use the service Zenfolio to store and display them.  I have an app that syncs with Zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone.  I set this app to store the photos on the Samsung SD card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away.  This morning the SD card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back.  It took a total of 3 restarts to get the music and photos back.December 18I have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times.  Very frustrating.  I ordered a SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP today for about $25.00 and I\\'ll see if I have the same issues.  Very disappointing.December 28I purchased and installed theSanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFPand copied all the files from the 64GB card to the new 32GB card.  No formatting, no fuss, no muss.  I have not had a phone reset since, have played music through Bluetooth for hours in the car, have viewed photos.  Everything just works.  Half the memory but what I have is always available and the phone works, a good trade off.  I am still disappointed that the 64GB did not work with the SG3.  I have purchased aelago Mobile Nano II USB 2.0 microSDHC Flash Memory Card Reader (Black)to use the 64GB MicroSDHC card as a thumb drive. Using this in my Samsung G3 cell phone as a memory card and expansion. it works ok for now, allthough not the card but the phone itself does have a slight issue with reading massive sd cards at this high compacity. I hope that samsung will release a software or firmware update to resolve the issue with reading the card on boot up of the phone sometimes. I have found that simply restarting the phone usually resolves the issue with reading the card. or any other error messages. Overall minus the slight issues it works great. Holds a lot of my stuff which I need, or at least I think I need, on long road trips. Pluggesd in the MicroSd csrd and it worked perfectly!  SanDisk has a solid performer here.  I\\'d recommend this product to anyone neededing this level of storage and speed. I bought a new Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone and needed an expansion card to boost up the memory for photos and music.  This is the cheapest 32Gb card I could find.  Works well. I\\'ve never had any issues with SanDisk, I always buy and trust their product. I bought this one for the Sansung Galaxy Note 10.1 and works very nicely. I wife loaded all her books and music on it and still huge amount of space left. SanDisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSDHC Class work the best in my dash cams... I bought a Mobile Micro SD Reader to use to read the small cards and it too work great .. When I bought this a year ago, I had problems with it working properly in my Sprint E4GT (Galaxy SII).  The card kept waking up the phone to be read, over and over.  SanDisk acknowledged this problem in &#34;some&#34; android devices and shipped me a new card once I returned this one to them.  The new card still had the same problem, so I gave up.  The card is fast, and I got a good deal on the price, so I am pretty disappointed about it. Works great in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Fast and reliable, what more could you want from a data storage device. Hi:I ordered two card and they arrived the next day, even faster than Prime. Unfortunatey, this 64gb MicroSD card is designed to only work with ex-fat. If you\\'re an ex-fat fan and don\\'t ever plan to change, this is the card for you. I\\'ve been able to take all of the previous 64gb MicroSD cards I\\'ve ordered, put them in an adapter and format them in my Windows 7 desktop. I\\'m a NTSF fan and find it to be much more stable in tablets.With other cards that aren\\'t intentionally crippled, I can format the card to NTSF on Monday, ex-fat on Tuesday, Fat32 on Wednesday. It\\'s ex-fat or the highway for SanDisk.You can use EaseUS Partition Master to format the card to Fat32 for devices such as cameras and mp3 players and many, many, many others that don\\'t support ex-fat. That being said, you only get one shot. Once it\\'s formatted into Fat32, attempting to format back to Exfat or NTSF hoses the card. I couldn\\'t reformat to NTSF no matter what I tried. Once again, don\\'t bother trying to format in your computer, ex-fat is the only choice.Any card that needs a special utility to format to anything other than ex-fat shouldn\\'t be supported. Don\\'t buy it! It\\'s designed to fail.Shame on you Sandisk!Update 9/24/12:***************************I spoke with Sandisk technical support and they confirmed that Sandisk Ultra 64gb MicroSd cards are not compatible with Android 4.0 and above. This would be for Class 10, SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A as well as SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 30MB/s Memory Card with SD Adapter (NEW VERSION) - Retail Packaging with Komputerbay SDXC USB Reader.I did not have any success formatting the class 10 card with EaseUS Partition Master. SanDisk recommended the free utility, HPUSBDISK.exe and I successfully downloaded it from Softpedia. I was  unable to format the card with NTSF but successfully converted one of the cards to Fat32 for a friend who wants to use it in a SanDisk mp3 player, that of course is not compatible with ex-fat.Acting on Sandisk advice I am returning the unopened class ten cards with the KomputerBay reader. I spoke with a patient and gracious tier-one tech support person and the party line seems be that consumers only use MicroSD cards in phones. I don\\'t know what they\\'re thinking: cameras, mp3 players, tablets, adapters and so on. Anyway it\\'s a known issue.I can confirm that the class 6  64gb MicroSD card can be formatted in Windows7 back and forth to most any format so after returning four class 10 cards, I\\'m back to class six.It\\'s still unconscionable to deliberately design these cards to be incompatible. I hope SanDisk will come up with a solution or recall the cards. Buyer beware.Update: 9/29/12**********************I received my two replacement class 6, 64gb MicroSD cards and it took less than five minutes to open the horrible packaging and to perform a quick format to NTSF. Done!I gave my friend the Class 10 64gb MicroSD card formatted into Fat32 by HPUSBDISK.EXE and he couldn\\'t read it on his computer. As it turns out, the class 10 cards are not only incompatible with most devices bur also with most usb card readers.  Another trip across town.I can confirm that the IOGEAR SD/MicroSD/MMC Card Reader/Writer GFR204SD (Green/Gray) selling on Amazon for $6.99 works. So after countless hours of wasted effort, my friend has a card formatted to Fat32 that works with a SanDisk mp3 player.Once again, SanDisk has admitted that these cards are not compatible with Androd 4.0 or above, that being 100% of Android tablets and a majority of Android phones. These cards are intentionally crippled by design.To quote a friend:\"Per the SDHC standard, the format is FAT32. SDXC (64 GB and larger) the spec calls for exFAT. Microsoft has limited the OS to only format larger cards as exFAT and will not allow FAT32. Also, seems they have found a way to also block NTFS. Thus far, very few Android devices can read exFAT because they refuse to pay M$ for licensing of the exFAT file system. \"To all masochists out there--buy this card. To everyone else--unsafe at any speed. I have had it for six months or so now and have had no problems with it. It\\'s awesome. Thanks! I thought every app could be transferred into the sd card but no. The description said that I would speed up the device a little but I think it got slower, I have samsung device and its not faster at all and not improving it also. I love this sd card I realy do RECOMMEND IT. But there are some pitty partsnto it. Still love it~~ Worked exactly as advertised, good price, happy with our purchase. Will probably wait for the 64gb version to drop a bit in price before I get one for my phone. This one was for the wife. This does not lock in perfectly into a Surface 2. It locks in but you have to force it. Other than that it gives you about 59gb once installed. I only ever use SanDisk and have never had a problem, This is for my Wife\\'s new 1st smartphone, so needed a class 10 and Amazon always has the best price, either in the US or Amazon UK I plugged this little dude into my Galaxy S4 and have been living with the luxury of being able to store and carry around all my music.  Very good value and I would highly suggest! I ordered two 32GB and two 64Gb versions of these memory cards (but I can write only one review per Amazon). Two 32GB cards went into a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to 32GB cards -- and one 64GB card went into my Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phone. The second 64GB card\\'s a spare.The Galaxy S3 phone accepted the 64GB MicroSD card with no problems -- except for the fact that my Galaxy S3 only recognizes 59.7GB of the 64GB MicroSD card. I have no idea why it does that and why I lost over 5GB of an empty MicroSD card but I\\'m okay with that -- I guess. 60GB\\'s is still plenty. The transfers of music, videos, and pictures between the phone\\'s internal 16GB memory and the 64GB MicroSD card is wayyy faster than the old SanDisk 16GB MicroSD card that was in there. The same noticeably faster speeds between my desktop computer and the 64GB MicroSD card were also smile inspiring.As for the SanDisk MicroSD cards -- they work great and seem to operate pretty darn fast. They\\'re definitely faster than the old 16GB SanDisk MicroSD cards I had installed in my camera and cell phone(s).Now -- as for the shipping -- dismal! I ordered two 32GB along with two 64GB MicroSD cards on August 21 during an Amazon Gold Box sale. According to the tracking feature they didn\\'t even transmit the shipping info to the carrier (USPS) until August 31. All four were shipped together. I didn\\'t receive them until September 6 -- a full 16 days after I ordered. A little over two weeks for four tiny items that were indicated on the Amazon page as being -- \"In Stock. Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\" -- at the time of purchase. They also shipped all four tiny MicroSD card packages in a way over-sized box which the USPS couldn\\'t fit into the mailbox so I had to make a cross-town trip to the US Post Office and stand in a very long and slow moving line to pick up the box. They could have all four EASILY fit in one small envelope. Even a small padded envelope. I left packaging feedback on that already.This is the 3rd straight time that Amazon shipping was horrible over the last several months -- and that is why the 2-star rating. This is not the Amazon shipping that I remember. The samsung  S4 is only 16G not enough so I bough this 32G plug to have more storage , so far I have no problem, music, video, copy/delete file do all kind of thing still good. What I needed - good price ! I am using this for my s3 and it works well. Takes pictures in an instant. What more can be said?  This card is made by the leader in flash memory and was a reasonable price and very fast. great price for such a super big storage. works well and so far no problem. will highly recommend for smartphones and tablets. good memory card. no issues. works as it should. price is great when you are able to find it on a lightning deal! Had to give it 4 stars because when formatted it only provides 28GB.  Not as clean as I would have expected a SanDisk product to be.  Especially a Class 10 product. I like this 32 GB micro memory card, it has a lot oF storage space for videos and photos.  I use it in my Spy Camera Mini Clock Radio. It\\'s a fast, affordable cheap microsd card. What more could I say? San disk too, so it\\'s definitely a good brand to buy. This may be the worst memory card I\\'ve ever purchased - and I have bought a lot of card over the years - wish I had just stuck with my ADATA cardsFirst issue - I lost a bunch of photos - they just did not exist at all - it was as if I never took them  - but since there was a large gap in the file names I know for sure I didOf 200 photos taken about 40 in the middle just disappearedi could not even recover them using a deep scan toolI\\'ve been shooting digital since the mid 90s and this is the first time anything like this has ever happenedThen there is the cheesy SD adapter - the switch was so loose it switched to locked while I was taking pictures.Luckily the camera warned me that the card was read only - after having already taken a bunch of shots that has saved without issueFinally I figured I could just use these in my Samsung phones - no such luck - the second I put them in and took a photo I got an error that it could not right to the card and I could no longer see the 8gig of photos that were on itYes this may be a know issue with the cards - I see a review mentioned that - and I see that SanDisk will replace them - but they cannot replace the photos I lost - so keep that in mind when considering this card - I will I bought two of these. One for my Galaxy S3 and the other for my Samsung Tablet. Had no problems using it with either one. A definite must have. Works great, in my phone now I was running out of space but this came to the rescue now I can take more pics!!! i know what my title says, and it\\'s the actual amount on the card, which is really good. other cards that i own have a greater difference per advertised amount. i use it for my lenovo lynx tablet and it works perfectly. I chose this for it\\'s size, both physically and virtually. I recently got a new phone that can support 64GB and because I have a lot of music photos and videos, this was a no-brainer, especially since it\\'s rare to find any other 64GB micro SD, SanDisk is the only one I can find, but that\\'s not a bad thing, I trust this brand. It\\'s kind of hard to review a micro SD because if it works, it works, there\\'s not much to it. I used this SD card on my Nvidia Shield and works as advertised very quick transfer speeds. Bought it for my Android cell phone (Moto Droid X2) and it works great. Very fast, plays MP3s with no skipping, transferred apps that could be moved to the SD card with no problems to create more internal memory space. Wasn\\'t sure it was necessary to get a class 10 card, but this SanDisk ultra 32 GB allowed me purchase a good quality card at a very reasonable cost. This card has lots of room for everything. A Class 10 card for about $20, you can not go wrong. Not much more to say; it\\'s a good quality SD card that does the job (presently in a Galaxy S5) with no issues whatsoever.  As you\\'d expect. I bought this micro card to use in a security camera for continuous recording. It works perfectly and is the ideal size for all night surveillance. The San Disk name offers confidence in quality. I just installed it and working OK so far Bought this by accident for my Samsung Galaxy s3 but the phone reads it and accepts all 64 gb so I am a happy camper. Worked the first time so I bought one more for my Galaxy Tab 2. Again, no problems! Awesome card! Just what I needed for my Tablet. Recommend the product and getting one for my phone too. Fits my expectations. Este fue una buena compras ha sido todo lo que esperaba del producto. Fue un bueno producto. Llego en el momento indicado. I\\'m not sure what else to say other than, &#34;it works&#34;.  I use this card with my Sandisk Wireless Flash.....I think I\\'ll buy a couple more. Shopped around a bit and this was by far the best deal on this card. Works great in Galaxy S3. I really enjoy the generous storage space that my Samsung Galaxy SIII has. Every once in a long while I have to unmount/remount the drive but I doubt it\\'s the card and most likely the phone. I would highly recommend. as described. took 3 weeks to arrive from china but its the real thing, same as picture. Speeds are good, 30mb/s read, 10mb/s write. Great Card but poor packaging don\\'t understand why these manufactures seem to think that putting all this plastic wrap all over the cards is good, anyway the card is high quality sturdy and quick to save and pull information from on my wife\\'s Samsung Galaxy S3 I got this to allow me to store and move movies and photos.  It holds a lot and playing videos straight from the card works fine.  So, it does what I needed it to do.  You generally can\\'t go wrong with genuine SanDisk products. This micro SD with adapter works fine.  I have no complaints.  If there was one thing I would wish for is a little less packaging --- it was over packaged for something sent mail order. this gave me enough storage to record 2 long scuba dives at full 1080p @ 60FPS without having to transfer to the computer.  Thats close to 2 hours.  It comes with an adapter to use with other sd devices too.  Very Happy with it. I was really excited to get this because I hadn\\'t changed my MicroSD card in my phone since I got the original droid.  I was so excited to see how much faster the write/read speeds would be.It worked great at first but then my phone started to tell me that it was unrecognizable and it kept ejecting it. I thought maybe it was a formatting issue so I reformatted it from my phone (Galaxy S4) but it just did the same thing.After a week of this I was very irritated and decided to give up and just return it and get another one. I was scared that it would do the same thing because many other people had issues with these cards in the galaxy\\'s.To my surprise the new 32GB card that amazon sent back to me has been working great where as the other one would have been ejecting every other hour.I am really happy with amazon and their return policy. It was very fast and easy, I can honestly say I\\'ve never returned something so fast and so easy, they literally sent it next day delivery and at no cost to me.The only reason I gave it one star off is because I had to return the first one, other than that the product has been great so farI am extremely happy with amazon\\'s service.As far as the SD card I\\'d definitely get another one if it worked like the one I have now. Easy to use, no thought necessary and plenty of storage for movies to use on my Microsoft Surface Pro 2 Use this in my Samsung galaxy s4. Never have an issue. I recommend at least a 32 gigabyte card if you have a smart phone Works great; should last a long time! I purchased this card to use in a GoPro Hero 3. It keeps up with the 1080p video being wrote to it. I don\\'t know if it would do 4k video, but 16GB wouldn\\'t be enough for that type of quality either. Bravo SanDisk. Got it to use with my Go Pro. This was cheaper than getting the regular SD Ultra card (Class 10). The read/write speed isn\\'t quite as good as the regular SD Ultra card (Class 10), but it gets the job done. Shipped fast, great price, exactly as described! Great micro card for my wife\\'s Moto Defy XT.  Lot of breathing room to install apps and take pics and vids. The data speeds are kinda slow but I am enjoying this card and thinking of buying a 64GB, nice buy. I purchased this to increase the storage on my tablet. Plugged in and worked immediately and was very affordable. I am not a tech expert but it seems to have no problem saving large video clips and playing them back. There was 1 cheaper than this, but this seemed to have better reviews so I went with this one. It was about half the cost of the cheapest one I could find at the big box store. Loaded up my mp3 collection in no time for use in my phone, came with SD adapter and in very small packaging, almost nothing to throw away! Card has worked great in my phone so far, no lag on video or audio. Good deal @ 30usd As others have found, these cards do not last. Mine died in less than 2 months. Lost several photos that I had not backed up yet. The warranty replacement died within 3 months.Go with another brand. I\\'ve been using a Kingston and so far, 9 months later, still working. So far, no complaints. Excited about the price. Excited about the size. I only hope my files won\\'t get erased randomly. I will try to update this in a few weeks. fast and holds all my music and larger apps. So far it has worked very well, stores more that I need which is a great feature. Another nice feature is the red paint, really, I drop these little cards and the all black version are often hard to find, the red is easy to spot, now if it only glowed in the dark..lol Fast saves in my Nikon Coolpix S8200. Here\\'s my test: I was traveling with my tablet, laptop and camera, when my laptop crashed. No longer able to transfer photos from camera to laptop via my class 10 SD card, I bought the only microSD card that the big box store had (a class 4). The class 4 microSD card with adapter worked in my Nikon Coolpix but I kept seeing messages to wait while the card finished saving. Since switching to the SanDisk microSDHC class 10, there have been no more wait messages on my camera. Works very well in all devices I\\'ve tried it in (Note 8, Hisense Pro, Razr M). No complaints. Great price for tons of storage. Excellent secondary storage device! I have one installed in my mobile phone, and one in my tablet. They have greatly enhanced my multimedia options. My phone has over 4000 songs on it with room for more. My tablet has about 42 full-length good quality movies loaded. I purchased and use with my Surface.  It stores quickly and is easy to use.  I really like that SanDisk makes it compatible with regular SDXC and Micro.  Good product. I\\'m using this in a SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 16GB unlocked smartphone and the only problem is as you write more and more flies to the card it gets slower and slower to the point that you\\'ll be so p.o at a crucial moment , say for example you want  to access a video  or doc , that when you do actually get your file you\\'ve lost  all faith in the card .So buy it for the capacity but always remember it\\'s not reliable  for fast access. Added space for movies, games, books, pictures, and music. Also great to relive the carrier\\'s stock S4 for space. All major US carriers only supported the 16GB version of the S4 There are plenty of these on the market, but SanDIsk is a brand I trust, great size, and a really good value. Bought this for a recently acquired GoPro 3. Stuck it in and had no problems. I would recommend these cards looking for a micro SD for any electronics that need them. Great balance between price, performance and reliability. Bought 2 of them for each of our new S4 phones and they both work great.  No issues.  Saves pictures to card fast, transferred music from PC to card fast and I can play and view pictures and videos with no problems. Work perfect in my GoPro camera. I have always found San Disk are the best. I would definitely buy again. I have had a few different brands of SD card\\'s and I keep coming back to Sandisk. The price and quality is great. High speed class 10 memory works great in my new Microsoft Surface RT (saved my over $80 for an addition 32GB from MS). All of my work for the past decade fits into 32GBs. At $19, it costs less than any other class 10 card (in other words, it\\'s the fastest at this price). It\\'s plenty fast for me. But, as reviewer NLee points out, it is very easy to confuse this with much slower class 6 cards (so be careful as you compare). This card worked as soon as I plugged it in - with no problems. Highly recommended. Now, some test the Transend microSD as faster (see first commend for one URL), but performance is more likely limited by your reader. SanDisk is the most popular for good reasons (#1 selling microSDHC card at Amazon). Now, this also means it is the most popular to counterfeit (the likely source of most poor experiences - recent sources estimate that millions have been purchased just on eBay and others have confirmed getting fakes through Amazon vendors). This comes with a SDHC adapter.Some (more expensive) cards you may want to consider (reliability and compatibility issues with others):Transcend Information TS32GUSDC10 32GB micro SDHC10 Flash Memory - No Box or Adapter(without adapter)Samsung 32GB High Speed MicroSDHC Memory Card with SD adapter(with adapter)Other items I also got for my MS Surface RT:Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini HubFosmon HDMI to Micro HDMI Cable (6 Feet)HDE Wireless USB Presentation Remote Clicker PenVG Hydei Edition Black Nylon Protective Carrying Bag with Removable Shoulder Strap for Microsoft Surface Windows RT 10.6-inch ClearType HD Display Tablet (32GB 64GB)Plugable USB 2.0 to 10/100 Fast Ethernet LAN Wired Network Adapter for Macbook Air, Chromebook, Windows, Wii, Wii U, Linux, and Specific Android Tablets (ASIX AX88772 chipset)GOgroove DynaMIX Noise-Isolating Earbuds w/ Microphone for Google Nexus 7 / Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 / Asus Transformer / Coby Kyros / Kindle Fire / Microsoft Surface / iPad & More - Incl. Cleaning Kit i choose this card to eliminate worries when i travel far away from home . very quick and look so strong More storage for my phone. Easy to insert, it\\'s really small hence micro, so make sure you don\\'t end up losing it before you get it into your phone. I\\'m really happy with this product and decent price too. Started acting erratically after about a month, it\\'s now been a little over a month and all my files are gone. Not all of them were able to be backed up. I hope I can get at least the pictures back. Glad the S4 backs up photos automatically... Sd card works perfect just as you would expect I would recomend this sd card to any one with a camera I never know what to write on these types of items...SanDisk is a name brand, I have never had a problem with any of their products.It works great in my I-Kam Extreme video glasses and the data transfers easily to my desktop pc. Just got a new Razor Max HD with 32 GB and wanted to add more memory, paid a few more bucks for Sandisk and it\\'s always worth it!  The phone recognized the additional memory and I\\'m good to go with 64 GB now. Not a lot to say about this memory. Sits in my S4 phone with no issues. Does not appear to have any lags. Actually their is an EXTREME version but the price is about double and since I am not planning to shoot in 2.7 or 4K their was no need to pay more and get no improvement. Grabbed 2 of these, one for my father for his Great for my GoPro HERO 3+ Black Edition and both cards worked as expected. Works great with 1080p @ 60FPS in the GoPro and I imagine it probably would work for 2.7 and maybe it would work with 4K but again not bought with that intent so these perfectly suit our needs. Price of micro SD per GB is much lower compared to a few years ago.Works fine with LG G2x and Galaxy Note 2.With all the new phones with more than 6M pixels and 1080p video, your internal storage is going to dry out very fast. External Micro SD is definitely a must.4GB and 8 GB are running out very fast :(. 32GB is definitely a welcome (especially if you buy it during the sale)Pro:1. Bought this during sale - under 25 USD.2. Class 10 - fastest (for now)3. Trusted brand: SanDiskCons:None. I think the title says it all. This card is &#34;Super Fast and Works Great&#34;. So happy to have this in my phone. (Samsung Galaxy SIII) I bought this to go into the new Samsung Galaxy Note 8 tablet I bought. Works like a charm and big enough to hold my data. I\\'ve wasted time and money trying other company\\'s SD and MicroSD cards, some work all right, and some died on me, it\\'s not the price that you pay but rather the value that you get. Let me tell ya, SanDisk makes the best memory cards, period..... I bought one of this card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone, mostly for movies and music. I usually use AnyDVD & Handbrake programs to convert movies (large MP4 also playable on my Samsung tablet) and simply copy-and-paste movies and musics on this little card. Both my phone and tablet read this card without any problem and I cannot imagine my phone without it. Now I\\'ve bought 2 more.... Sandisk announcement of the first 128GB micro SD took internet by storm. Our phones evolved into multimedia powerhouses with 5.5&#34;-6&#34; displays, desktop grade processing power, OTG support for external peripheral accessories, powerful cameras, and more. The only thing was missing a super high capacity internal removable storage at an affordable price. 128GB micro SD announcement finally filled that gap, supported by amazon current sale of $119 shipped, but the question still remained if some of the older smartphones will be able to handle/recognize this capacity. I was personally curious considering original Note 2 spec was calling for support of up to 64GB only.Now, about the card itself. Its their Ultra edition with a read speeds of up 30MB/s and Class 10 performance. As part of Ultra edition it\\'s considered to be waterproof, temperature-proof, x-ray-proof, magnet-proof, and also shockproof. In addition to a flash card itself, it also includes SD adapter for compatibility with digital cameras and also direct reading on laptops/PCs support SD card.So here comes the verdict: IT WORKS with Note 2!!! My Note 2 is all stock, Verizon SCH-I605 version, running stock Android 4.3. I checked the card first with an adapter on my laptop and then mounted it on my Note 2 where it was recognized with a right capacity. I also ran A1 SD Benchmark app (both long and accurate benchmark tests) to verify it with success. Read/write speed were not quite near 30MB/s, but it\\'s still pretty good.My opinion? This card takes multimedia powerhouse Note 2 to the next level!!! Now you don\\'t have to be limited and can store your favorite albums in FLAC audio format, or have a small library of your favorite movies stored permanently, or take more high def videos, and so on. Just always stay up to date with backups. If flash card fails, it will be covered under warranty, but your pictures and videos will be lost forever. I have used this in my smart phone for about 5 months with no problems.  I read other reviews on the specifics and decided that this was the best option.  I have not had any issues and would recommend this product. works great for the price ad I use it for music and pictures. cant beat the quality and reliability of this brand I bought it for my galaxy tab 10.1 and formatted it to FAT32.  Works excellent and i have more than enough space for what ever i need on my tablet.  going to buy another one for my Handy cam! Bought this to go into my Galaxy Note II. My phone recognized it and started using it immediately and automatically.  Very happy with purchase and would recommend to anyone with a Galaxy Note II. pretty good! had a hiccup then they were pretty helpful and fixing the problem! used for my go pro and works freaking great! Not cheap but really quite amazing that they can now fit so much info on such a small item. Already have a 16 GB version and expect this will perform the same. Comes with an adapter and also a plastic case that holds both the micro sd card and adapter which is nice.Almost wish they made a bigger capacity version as I use this with a GoPro and even this 64 GB model will fill up quickly. I get 59.8GB of space on this in my Razr Maxx. I swapped it in in place of the factory 16GB one and had the system format it. It caused the phone to reboot, but after a reboot I had the full storage space. Seems quick enough to load... have not done full file transfer tests but loading 1700 songs onto it took about a half hour. I got this SD card for my android tablet. My only complaint is after the tablet installed its file system my computers would no longer recognize the SD card. Still love it. I needed a place to shove all my music videos for party portability. The write speeds are around 10-12MB a second, so it\\'s no barn burner, but read speeds are good enough to playback 1080p content, and that\\'s what really counts to me. Works flawlessly.  I dont buy any SD cards unless its from SanDisk.  Never had a problem with them and i know their class speeds are true or under rated compared to other brands. Yep. Works like it should. the micro card was a snap to insert into my tablet and now i have the extra storage should i ever need it.  i use sandisk cards on all my cameras also \\'cause they\\'re quality products, and i got this one for a great price too. Installed one of these in my Galaxy S4, nice addition. All my HD movies and audio files stream from this card, Perfect! Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Now I have 96GB total memory! Awesome! The price was quite good too Correctly priced. I bought it to use with my surface pro. Works great out of the box and transfer speeds are excellent. I\\'ve used many SanDisk memory cards over the years.  This one ranks way up there just like all the others.  I am using it in a Samsung Tablet and it does all I want it to do.  I cannot comment on speed, since that isn\\'t an issue to me.  For storage this is quite the gem.  And I bought it &#34;pretty cheap&#34;. I got this micro sd card strictly to hold music on my HTC One M8. I was able to fit approx 840 albums ripped at 192kbps vbr in AAC format using dBpoweramp. Couldn\\'t ask for anything better. 5 stars. It works just fine in my Galaxy 3s phone.  Now, I more room than I know what to do with. Works fine in a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - no need to format (although I did) - recognized as soon as it was popped in 59.47GB usable.Arrived really fast and nicely packaged.  I would order again. This is about the same as what you would pay at Costco but you don\\'t have to pay the sales tax. Same card lower price. Nice. I really don\\'t know that the complaints other posted were all about, but I have bought 3 of these sandisk micro sd card already.  for my phone, my wife and my daughter\\'s phone. store lots of movies, pictures. videos....etc. all works just fine, no issues at all. my slr has sd cards that take time for the next click thought this would solve the problem as it says its faster and a way better product but i don\\'t see that happening. SANDISK makes great products, I always try to buy their name. This is for the Sony digital recorder I also bought. I got the &#34;Ultra&#34; becuase it said it lets your camera phone save pictures faster, it seems to do that. Also, it was a great price. I purchased this Micro SD card with adapter to supplement my UltraBook which came with a MSata storage of only 128Gb.The 64 GB SD Card is a whole lot of storage and the prices of these have fallen to low in recent times and believe will fall further as newer technologies will come.I would recommend this 64GB original SanDisk Micro SD card for anyone who needs large storage space at good prices, especially for the Samsung Galaxy S2 & S3 or the UltraBooks. not much to be said about this. sandisk makes some of the best SD cards..i have even washed mine in the washing machine by mistake and it still works this item works great but maybe a better price would be better, I use it on my phones works great Been using this card in my Nokia Lumia 820 for over a year now. It gives decent speed and works good. No issues at all. I use this in my Galaxy S3 so that I can carry all my MP3s that are on my iPOD classic (45GB).The only complaint I have is not with this unit, but with smartphones in general.  They are still to sensitive to be used as a true mp3 player replacement.  If you are not too careful, you may crack the screen on your phone if you try to use it as an all-purpose media player.My ipod classic is five years old and it has yet to have its screen crack on me.  It definitely hold up better at the gym than my phone.  Anyway, this SDXC card is great. It amazing how much data they can fit on these tiny cards these days.  When I saw this 32gb class 10 card for $20, I snatched it up for my 10&#34; Android tablet to hold my library of kids DVD movies I converted to tablet video for my kids to watch while on the road.  It works great and the kids love it. Overall great price per gigs  real money saver . Expands my tablets memory 10 fold as well as keeping it from crashing Not much to say about this.  Works well with a Samsung Galaxy S2.  Haven\\'t tested the read/write speeds, but it seems about right for a Class 10 card. I\\'ve read a lot of reviews about this not working with the S3. I have had this for 6 months now and no issues yet. seems to work good in my gopro  have only had it a few days and if i have problems with it in coming months i will update this.. for not.. it works... I find this card seems to frequently stop working altogether and have to be reformatted, or simply re-seated. It\\'s hard to know if this is the fault of the device I use it in (a cellphone), or the card itself, so I can\\'t really hold that against it, but all I can say is that\\'s been my experience with this card, and not others. Love the micro sd card. It\\'s everything i wanted and needed. The packaging was hassle free and easy to open Known brand, good packaging and working well in the phone.I wish the reviews did not require a set number of words. I bought this for my father and he definitely enjoys the extra storage space. Who wouldn\\'t. It came in a timely manner and was easy to install. This product works as described.  It\\'s just not super quick.  I would recommend this product, especially, if you get it on sale. I placed it in my better half\\'s Samsung Galaxy 3 cellphone, and she was blown away with speed her phone now has. She comments on it all of the time. Most of the time, all I hear is &#34;Oh WOW&#34; I\\'m always happy with a SanDisk purchase. I am currently using this microSDXC in my cellphone Samsung G4, which is more than enough for pictures, videos, and document downloads. Very fast read and write. It\\'s quick, theirs clout behind the name and I haven\\'t had any errors/faults on the three (3) that I\\'ve bought thus far. Keep in mind, these are a dime a dozen these days, but not all are equal. Stick to a dependable brand, like SanDisk and spend the extra $1-$5. Very fast memory card. Excellent price here on Amazon as well. It still amazes me that this little fingernail sized memory card can hold 1600x more data then the hard drive of my first computer. Highly recommended. Sandisk once again lives upto its name as the pioneer. This SD card fits the need of today high performance apps and has excellent durability and fast transfer speeds. I got it at a good price, and it is nice to have 64GB of extra space for media to use in my phone. Acquired this card a month ago for use in my phone Samsung Galaxy S4 and only have taken issues with it.The micro sd card is really bad, the camera takes a long time to be ready and repeatedly resets the phone. Absolutely not recommend it in my previous phone (S3) used a micro sd card 32GB Samsung brand and never had problems with it.To correct the problem of instability recommend formatting the card, I did and the problem remains the same.Live outside the U.S. and I must acquire excellent quality products because the cost of returning it exceeds the cost of the product.Next time buy a card SAMSUNG brand that never gave me problems. For this capacity and price you can\\'t go wrong.  I\\'m not sure what class this is but they recommend higher class for video. I would recommend this product. Good luck Great little micro sd card!  The 64 GB of storage is awesome.  Very dependable brand.  I have this brand  for other devices and always works like a charm! Works great in my Samsung Note 2 and Samsung Ativ 500T. Just slide it in and nothing else to do! Bought this over a month ago and it still works great. been using it in my gopro 3+ snowboarding taking some heavy falls and have had zero issues! Memory arrived intact delivery was fast and I use it now with my galaxy i9505 LTE s4, funciana to perfection and longer will be able to record all my videos I installed this card in a Nook Tablet and attempted to transfer videos to the card from my Windows xp computer - - some transferred okay, others not. Thinking the card was defective I bought another one (same card type) and installed it with the same result. I have had no problems transferring videos to this card from my Windows 7 computer. What you buy this for is in there. 32 gb fast writing speed etc. happy with product. no issues yet Great for my LG Optimus G and super fast transfer speeds. And no lagging for the games the many 3D games on my android. Bought this for Samsung Galaxy S3 in Fall 2012 and that card works perfectly to this day.  Bought the same card in May 2013 for Galaxy S4 and it continuously mounts and unmounts.  Sometimes it is not even recognized by S4 or PC.  Amazon is awesome and pre-shipped a replacement.  It did the same thing, though.  According to Cnet, Sandisk acknowledged a &#34;manufacturing problem&#34; with these cards back in January 2013.  Said it was fixed, but the bad cards must still be sitting in warehouses.  Returned both and ordered Samsung\\'s 64gb micro sdxc card.  $12 more and slightly slower read/write specs, but works perfectly in S4 and I can\\'t tell the difference in its speeds compared to the Sandisk that works in my S3. Great micro SD high speed card for digital photography (I use in Sony HDR-CX160). The 16G storage can be sufficient for a short program. I use it in my Sansa Clip Zip 8GB MP3 player and now I have 40GB for music.The included adapter allows me to remove the card from my player and add and subtract music using a standard card reader on my computer without having to plug in my MP3 player.When I\\'m done I slip the micro card back into the player, let the MP3 player refresh itself, and I\\'m good to go.This card is a class 10 unit so it\\'s also good for expansion ports on Video cameras as well.-v- Amazon as the best prices for these, period. I used this card in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 8.0.  No issues! Good bye video camera. Just stick this in your Galaxy Phone and take high def video all day! TONS of storage for an amazing price! Great speed on both my DSLR and Smartphones. Great Sandisk quality as usual.Although other brands may be cheaper at times, I normally look to Sandisk first, and will usually buy it over other brands unless there is a large price difference. Product arrived on time as expected and worked exactly as advertised. A good buy on a product that will be used as part of a surveillance system. I purchased this SanDisk 64 GB memory card so as to get the full benefit for my Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0, when I received it from Amazon, I just inserted it in the Note 8.0, and within seconds, it was recognized (shows as 59.47 GB) and I installed ebooks, Magazines, music, pdf files, photo\\'s and several full length movies and still have much more room to spare.  The price was right and I wanted the 10 UHS-1 speed so as to take full advantage of my Note 8.0.  SanDisk memory cards have never failed me so I\\'m very pleased with this card. with the black friday discount the price is great. i got free shipping by bundling other items to meet (over $35) free shipping. comes in sandisk package so it is nice to know it is not a black market knockoff. i bought 2 of these babies. Tons of storage and the read and write speed it an added bonus. Blows people away how quick my phone\\'s ready to take the next pic. Sandisk is the best out there and this ultra is even better!  Currently using it on a dashcam I have installed in my vehicle.  Its a shame smart phones seem to be going away with external memory so they can eventually start charging you for cloud storage. It works fine so far - easy to quickly upload data on this microSD - bought this for my daughter who uses this with her Samsung Galaxy Note tablet that was also purchased on Amazon - will update if I see issues. I have nothing bad to say about these little guys! They arrived as expected, they fit into the devices and they work as stated! :D Works perfectly. I can take the microSDHC from my Galaxy Player and use the adaptor to plug it into my iMac with no problem at all. Works perfect, has no archive issues at all! Looks and feels pretty durable! Recommended for high end video and photography devices! I have tried to copy out the files and it is an astonishingly 40MB/s  Not sure why others are getting such low speed read but it think it is the computer.  Mine is running Core i7, SSD and 16GB ram.  Probably it is why so.  Nevertheless, will see how durable is this microsd card. I bought this awhile back. and I must say it worked just fine and exactly what I needed. its nice. I have it more then half of year now and still can not believe how they manage to fit 64GB on that small piece of plastic.. :) It writes according to SanDisk app test only with the speed of 16mb/second. I have expected a little more than that. Perfect and fast. This microsdxc is just what I need for my surface tablet. Just plug and play operation with no issues. 32 gb card is unredable...tablet cant read it, camera cant read it... Unable to format it... And  i dont havve 20 words...I have 30$ less... I bought this card for my Samsung Galaxy S3.  Unfortunately it failed after 4 months.  I contacted SanDisk and they promptly sent me another.  It has been going strong for 6 months. What can you say? It works like advertised and has a flair for its design. Fantastic for my GoPro Here 3. Now I just have to get more! If you want TONS of storage on your phone or device this is the answer. The card is also FAST I can watch an HD movie or shoot one with my phone with no issues whatsoever.I upgraded from a 32g card to this newer faster one and can really tell the difference. The faster cards are worth the upgrade price. There really isn\\'t much anyone can say that\\'s bad about SD, they are the best around...SC Cards are the best you can get I don\\'t get too worked up about memory cards, usually try to buy at least class 10. I am sure this is a fine card, just the one I purchased was defective.  Replaced it with another brand, not wanting to try twice. I got this card specifically to use for making ClockworkMod/PhilZ recovery backups on my S4. I tried using my 64GB cards, but neither recovery properly supports exFAT file systems. Yes, you can reformat in FAT32 if you really want to, but it\\'s not optimal. Besides, I don\\'t really want to carry 10+ GB of data backups around with me on a daily basis when I could carry music or videos instead. So now I leave this card safely tucked away on my desk and only use it when necessary. Works great! Use it to store music and stuff in the cell phone...have had no problems or bad sectors.The included adapter is great for using it in the computer Fast memorycard, the only type of memory card I\\'ll purchase. I\\'ve grown as they have grown. 4, 8, 16, 32,64 GB So far my experience with all SanDisk memory products has been nothing but excellent. They work in all products I\\'ve tried them in and are reliable. I have two of the 32GB cards, one is used in Samsung Galaxy S and the other in Sony Nex-5 camera. This is a very fast card.  I have 2 or 3 of them now, and have had them for a few years, and they are all still working. This is the reason why I love non-apple products. You can increase memory with microsd\\'s and its so much cheaper. These class 10 Sandisks\\' are amazing. I\\'ve bought several from 64gb to 16gb and every single one has lasted. I\\'ve had the 64gb for months now and I have no issues. The 16gb I\\'ve had for a year and its great. I would highly recommend this product. PROsIt copies large files to the card at ~10-12 MB/s and it doesn\\'t choke when slammed with a few hundred little files like pictures and mp3s. It writes 8mp images with a quickness and 1080p 20mbit recording is smooth in my LG Optimus G E970. I waited for these to get to ~this price before ordering, and as usual Amazon Prime is awesome.CONsNot as fast as the gold 16GB SanDisk microSD cards but for 64GB in this form factor, it\\'s faster than I was anticipating. see,,, I own an HTC HD2 with cyanogen Android Rom on it,, I wanted maximum memory capacity for various storage needs including shooting HQ videos ,,, I used to have a patriot 32GB Class 10 on it but the performance wasn\\'t up to my expectations ,,,this badboy right here peroformed like a champ on my smartphone ,,, Alert : \"IT WORKS ON HTC HD2\" ,,,,once I popped this card on my laptop to transfer my data on it,,, I got no less than 14MB\\\\S write speed which is above the specs of the this card,,,Apps access in FAAAST ,,, so far I\\'m pleased with it ,,, I\\'ll update this after a While when I use it intensively ,,,well done SanDisk ,,, Have more than one of these MicroSDHC disks and they hold up in my MP3 players, phone, recorder camera etc. super addition to my tablet,it gives me the space need for my music. I am very satisfied with quality as well as price. A fine product.  I\\'ve been using mine for over a year now, and it\\'s never punked out on me.  I just bought another one, to use as a spare.  Delivered on time, reliable, priced fairly. I own the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1I bought the 64g microSD card..(please keep in mind I know NOTHING about computers and I was able to do this.)I put it in the device to format...the tablet couldn\\'t read it.  Would never mount.  Tried to format it with my computer....and still just wouldnt work..although it would be formatted.  Remember, I was using all defaults.Sent it back, Amazon sent me another one. (Amazingly fast service)...same thing.I called Amazon...they knew of no issue why my tablet wouldn\\'t accept the card. (I would think that their customer service dept. would stay on top of these posts because I found that this was a HUGE issue)On my THIRD card I did some research.  For whatever reason for this SD card to work it must be formatted as a FAT 32 NOT an exFAT.  BUT...(this is the rub)...windows only allows for formatting either to exFAT or NTSF...(at first, I thought it was an adult swim reference).....so....that sucks....this means that I can\\'t use this card because I can\\'t format it properly.  But wait..there\\'s more....there is a super easy fix....any idiot can do it.....from start to finish took me all of 45 seconds (after reading instructions)...and ta-duh.....now the micro SD card works fine. Thank-you Amazon for your excellent return policy..(super fast, super easy, super friendly)...BUT your live customer service should know about this.  I can\\'t fault the operator...she was nice..seemed genuinely concerned and tried to make it right)...ok.. no more stalling..here is the address of the youtube video.  link to website is in the description.[...] ...link to website in description.  I used all defaults and worked perfect.  or search youtube - convert fat32 PERFECT,NO COMPLAINTS,USED AS A VIDEO CARD,ALMOST 5 HOURS OF VIDEO ON THIS LITTLE PIECE OF S,,,,,,,, HA I REMEMBER THE VHS TAPE,ARE WE GETTING CRAZY? never had a problem with it,it does exactly what it is made to do,love Sandisk product,smooth operation,high price but worth it.get it if you like to save,by waiting a day or two.enjoy People often ask me about bargain-basement pricing on no-name brands of media, and you know I just have to cite my own experiences with cheap media, and it\\'s just that, cheap media, prone to failure or worse if it\\'s a complex format as this one is, the SDXC format. They have crammed a TON of memory modules in that little bujgger, you know? I say go with experience, go with a leader in the field, so there\\'s pretty much SanDisk at the top of the heap, and the rest trail far, far behind in volume and precision assembly techniques...so I vote for SanDisk every time, and unless my experience is changed  by some anomaly I\\'ll keep on recommending SanDisk above all others.It\\'s rated at 40MB/sec write speed, which is enough to keep up with even the fastest real camera or phone camera out there in the wild, and it certainly keeps up with my Samsung Note 3\\'s 13-mega-pixel rocket camera, one that shoots up to 8fps in burst mode taking certain shots, so if it works for that camera perfect, chances are it will work for your setup great also!Buying the SanDisk memory module costs what, $5-$7 more than the others max, right? I say buy this one here, it\\'s a winner in all respects.Wavey Davey 1-12-2014 I am familiar with Sandisk and the quality of product is obvious to me because it installed in my Lumia 820 and it works great. bought for garmin gps. works very well. also has adapter for sdhc size memory card to plug into reader if you don\\'t have a micro card reader I bought two as a back up for my Gopro Hero 3.One from Amazon the other was a gift from BB.Both did not work in my cameras, thinking it was Gopro\\'s new update.Kept getting a SDERRI returned other and it worked with no problem.NOTE to all, there are boot-legged products out there It is hard todetect. But of all the Items I\\'ve received from Amazon/Prime and beyondHave been great. I just got stuck with a bad batch.GoPro recommends HX,HC,XC and extreme micro cards. Great buy for this SanDisk 16 GB memory. Worked well in my Samsung S4 smartphone. I mainly use the extra memory to save photos and music. Like the adapter that I use frequently to copies files to my desk top pc. Bought this to use in a video camera. It\\'s super fast and holds a ton of data. Buy this one! great price and great manufacture.  the item met my needs for my new phone, I\\'ll have ample storage now using this device. The memory card works as advertised and I have had no issues while using it with my GoPro Hero 3. What can I say? This card just works. I\\'m honestly not a fan of Sandisk since their 64GB Ultra MicroSD died on me soon after my baby was born. I lost several weeks of photos, and I was quite angry.To be fair, they did send a new one after I sent them a photo of the old one snapped in half. Now I have a lot more room on my phone. It can be overkill for some but extra space is only wasted if you never use it. This chip has done very well for my Samsung galaxy note 2. I would highly recommend getting this brand. I have had other brands to have failed and taking all of my data with it. This microSd card works well with my mobile phone and tablet PC. It was delivered to me in a speedy way than I had ever expected. I love it and would recommend it to my friends. I use it for a tablet. I can only say it works with my tablet and it doesn\\'t break. No more remarks. We ordered two of them, one for me and one for my sun.We use them on our Galaxy 3 phones and have never hada problem.  I never worry about space on my phone now. randomly died out of nowhere. i have the camera on for about 2 min and the card worked. turned the camera off and back on a few min later and the card no longer worked. I have no idea what happened but this seems to be a common problem with these cards. Bought this for my Note 10.1 for some extra space(also use one in my Note 2) No problem being recognized. Now if only Samsung would let me install apps on it, but that\\'s not the cards fault. Got this for Galaxy Note 2. Started receiving \"unexpectedly removed\" messages. Now card is dead and no longer working.  This can be Googled for known issues. Will be contacting Amazon for replacement.  Felt compelled to share. fast. however, im not sure if this card case is any more water proof than a normal card. i have been told all of them are water proof. i think this card is faster than several others i use though I didn\\'t format the card 1st and it cost me my video. Don\\'t do what I did; format the card then use it (Windows PC) I\\'m not sure if you have to format 1st when using MAC. I used a PNY SDHC 16gb card and it did just as good as the SanDisk and it cost about $15 less, I think that\\'s the better way to go, you\\'re getting the same results just not as long of video time. When I first inserted the card in my computer it wouldn\\'t recognize it.  Had to &#34;jiggle&#34; it around in the card reader, and then it took a long time for my computer to finally recognize something was there.  When I tried to read and/or format the card it kept telling me &#34;There is no disc installed in removable drive E&#34;.  I wasted a lot of time trying to find a cause/fix before I tried a different SD adapter.  As soon as I changed adapters the card worked perfectly. Memory card works great in my phone and other micro sdhc compatible devices. Do be sure to look out for the compatibility of your device. Some are not sdhc compatible. Luckily everything I have now is compatible. The 32gb size is excellent especially for embedded devices. I use mine with the Raspberry Pi using the adapter and it\\'s speedy. This is a wonderful product.  May not hold my whole library, but close enough.  Works great with the Galaxy Note 10.1, just need to reformat it as FAT and you\\'re good to go. This little memory card is quite fast and it gives me a ton of expansion storage on my Galaxy S3. File transfers from the phone\\'s internal storage or over a USB connection to my PC from the card when it it\\'s in my phone are a lot faster than I anticipated. The included adapter for using the microcard in a PC SIM Card Slot doesn\\'t work. I\\'ve tried reading the microcard using the full size SIM  adapter in three different PC\\'s and had  no luck at all. I think the adapter is just junk. You need to format this card to FAT32 before using it in your cell phone, otherwise it will not work. My Samsung Galaxy S3 kept giving me beef until I did so. It\\'s handy to have a laptop sitting around that has a port that can take this card with its adapter in.Luckily I had one such laptop lying around. Otherwise, this card works great and holds quite a bit of space. Giving it 4 stars for the initial grief with formatting it. IIRC I used a tool called Fat32 Format, but it\\'s on my laptop so I haven\\'t checked. I\\'ve seen some reviews of Micro SD media that complains about it working for only a certain number of re-writes before it fails. I\\'ve been using these SD cards in dash cameras for the last 6 months and they are still working great! Used on: Nokia Pureview 808 for video and photographyPro: was cheap and fastCons: will freeze from time to time or disk error message comes in and I would lose things I\\'ve either photographed or filmed using my Nokia Pureview 808. In order to make the microsd work, I have to restart my phone every time. The error message comes and go.07.17.13 UpdateI returned and exchanged my card with a new one free of charge by Amazon who\\'s willing to pay for shipping too. It turns out, my previous microsd ultra class 10 sandisk was a defective card. The new card I receive works well now and no error message pops up on my Nokia pureview 808 smartphone. I can now film and take pictures with it without having to worry. Thanks Amazon. Added this card to my Note 2 for massive storage capacity. Phone recognized the card without any issues and it\\'s been solid since its installation. Read/write when plugged into a computer is blazing fast. I bought this because I needed more storage for Asus TF700T tablet and this was the largest capacity microSD card I could find. Card came preformated with the exFAT file system which is recognized by the Asus TF700T tablet and many other Android devices. The only reason I take a star off is because I can\\'t attain transfer speeds anywhere near the 30 MB/s that SanDisk claims (I averaged around 8 MB/s which is fine for utilizing media on the tablet, but made the initial transfer of 30GB of files onto the card a slow process). The 32gb holds alot and when they say that this memory card is fast, they mean it. Holds everything I need on my android phone and works well with it. Had a few issues with the phone primarily but it was resolved when I reset the phone (note: The phone is an old Sony Xperia Ion Lt28a and has had issues from overuse so I needed to reset it regardless of the memory card). Once I finished setting up the phone and memory card from factory specs the devices worked like a charm. Still would not overrate it though so 3 like most of my other reviews. I have been pleased with the performance and price point for this card. No complaints, I would recommend it based on price & performance. My wife and I both own Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrockets, and I bought these to replace the cheap cards that we originally used in them.  The space is wonderful, and the whole phone seems faster with these cards installed.  Very happy with this purchase. Works great - I purchased two; one for my new cell phone and one for my new tablet. It\\'s a little more than SanDisk\\'s slow 16GB microSDHC, but cheaper than some other brands, and it works.Writes are a bit slow when the card fills up, but that\\'s endemic to all SD cards, and it\\'s not as bad as some other cards. Bought this for one purpose -- to plug into my Asus TF700T tablet.  Worked perfectly; nice and fast (fast enough, at least) and full 64GB capacity recognized. Using the card for videos and music, have already filled it up and it works great playing back my media! amazing storage and speed! what more could u want! its almsot cheaper then buying the full sized sd card z I finally have a micro SD card that I can use to transfer pictures from my computer to my photo printer.  Works flawlessly. The micro card also comes with an adaptor to allow use as a SD card.  I used it to increase memory in a cell phone and it worked perfectly. Fast data speeds, large capacity and worked right off the bat in my Samsung SIII. Love the fact it holds my large music and audio books library on the device. Purchase this for my asus tablet, read and write times are excellent, no problems so far.  came with case and adapter.  good price. Card is recognized as 59.5GB as expected.  I\\'m able to carry around all of my music without having to carry an iPod as well, now.  It came with a plastic case with an SD card adapter. I love the product!This is only a place you can review the product - not the handing! The handling sucked - the product is great! I ordered this to replace an aging Class 4 card being used with N2A (Nook 2 Android) KitKat 4.4.  This card turned that into a usable Android tablet!  N2A with the Class 4 card was brutally slow but now the tablet is very useful.  Definitely worth the upgrade. Great price for a great card. This is a genuine fast SanDisk brand card. It has worked flawlessly in my Sony DSC-TX200V. Pictures transfer to my computer very fast with a USB 3.0 card reader. I just plugged into my Samsung Note II and the phone recognized it without any issues. Everything worked perfectly.  I didn\\'t have to format or mess with it in anyway. I bought this to use on my tablet (an Asus Transformer TF101) to backup some of my data before I flashed a custom ROM. Works as expected out of the box; no formatting or fiddling needed. It comes with an SD card adapter and a little plastic case for it and the adapter. Android and the recovery kernels I\\'ve used have no trouble detecting whatever the default filesystem is on it.The one thing I would note: if you have an older SD card reader on your computer, it may not be able to read HC or XC micro SD cards. You may want to check if your read supports them.I recommend this to anyone who needs a SD or micro SD card for any purpose. It\\'s cheap, tiny, and has massive storage capacity for it\\'s size, so long as your device supports it. the packaging opens very easy and the micro sd card works flawlessly in my razor maxx hd and asus transformer. the product works after several months. i have no problems with it, and its holding out well! thank you very much Purchased two of these as they are the best. Yes there are faster SanDisk cards but this works just fine in the Note II . Man, this 128 (122gb actually) is amazing!  I had a 64gb card and been transferring my apps to the external card and ran out of memory.  With this bad boy, I can move anything I want, load it with tons of music and still have tons of space.  Highly recommended. I can\\'t believe how small memory cards are getting! This fantastic little device fits into an adapter that can be read by my MAC! Have been using this non stop for 6 months without any failure or problems. It is the fastest one that I have been able to find and all of this in a tiny little microSD. What can I say . . . ? It\\'s a SanDisk Class 10! They have been making SD, USB, and micro SD cards a long time! works great, i trust SanDisk for quality.  I would recommend this sd card to anyone who is looking for a large storage card for videos. Works great in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Hold a lot of data files, photos, and apps.  I may never use the full capacity of this reliable microSDXC Class 10 card. All I can say is that if you need a new SD card, dodn\\'t hesitate to buy this one.  Great deal and it works perfectly. Popped it into a Surface laptop/tablet. It worked straight way.Little card has a big memory by today\\'s standards. But in the morrow of the future it won\\'t bemuch space. For now, this is the maximum space for a MicroSDHC card. There ain\\'t no card bigger than this. There ain\\'t no 128 or 256 Gbs MicroSDHC card.Good deal. Fast arrival.What more can I write. Fast! Reliable! Huge storage. Already own 2 for my mobile devices. Transfer speeds are awesome. No problems to date. Great buy. I have used SanDisk memory cards in the past and never had a problem with them so it is worthwhile to buy a brand name. I purchased this to wxpand the memory in my Asus T100 hybrid windows 8.1 laptop/tablet. It came very quickly and in the easy open package (I hate plastic bublbe packaging). When it arrived I put it in the micro sd slot on my tablet and it just worked.  I got it when it was on sale, so it was a great value too. THE SANDISK ULTRS 64 GB MICROSDXC CLASS 10 UHS-1 MEMORY CARD WORK GOOD IN MY ATIV SMART 500T SAMSUNG WITH ADAPTER This is what you need for the external storage for any of the new Smart Phones or qny other compatible device. exactly what it says and cheap This chip is fast & solid.There really isn\\'t too much to say about this kind of memory.  My most appealing aspect is the fact that it has a MUCH faster access speed than many other SD cards. I am using the Fiio X5 and my current 64 GB SD card is full. My library is now bigger than 150 GB and this Sandisk 128 GB card had a price drop to $100 and with free shipping, it was a no-brainer to get it to accommodate all my music files. It worked as advertised and speed can be further improved but then I am limited by the read speed of my player X5. Overall, a good product with the big memory space which filled my needs. Recommended to buy again if there is a discounted price for this card. Else get 2 x 64 GB card, which is still cheaper than a 128 GB SD card. 5 months ago I placed this in a Galaxy phone and instantly increased storage by 200 percent. Worked and still works perfectly, and I was able to move all my pics, videos, and e-books to it. freeing up internal storage for apps.  Recommended. This card works perfectly. All I had to do was format it and pop it into my galaxy s3. Now I use it to keep some movies and all of my music on my cell phone. You won\\'t be unhappy with a SanDisk card, they even back them with a lifetime warranty. I purchased this for a friend and she\\'s very happy with it Best microSD card. SanDisk is a brand i trust for my SD and microSD card. Over the years, they have proven to be the most reliable and least expensive memory card sollution. I also bought the 64gb and you just can\\'t beat the price or the quality. I purchased this card for my Motorola Photon Q 4G LTE.  This is a well spect card and is nice and fast.  Installed with no problem.  If you looking for a higher end SD card for your phone or other applications and 32 gigs is what you need, you can\\'t go wrong here.  Highly recommended. High quality, high performance. Used to expand the memory on a DROID M. Inserted the card and we were good to go. Great for expanding smart phone storage and digital cameras. Bought this for a Samsung tablet which  arrived busted. The tablet long gone back.Still got the Sandisk which is looking for a home in a another tablet. Good value for product. I wanted 64 GB to put all my music on my phone.  Easily transferred from from hard disk to microSD via USB cable. Very fast, this is the best one you can get. I use it on my asusprime and I could see the difference with the previous one. Used this card to upgrade the memory the kids Tab 2 then it was moved to the kids S3. Thanks. What a bargain!  64GB of memory for all of your music and movies.  I bought this and the Galaxy S4 and couldn\\'t be happier.  This much memory in an iPhone would cost an arm and leg.Comes with a SD size attachment so you can easily transfer files straight from your computer. Bought it as addition to my tablet Samsung Note 10.1 edition 2014. IS great for storing pictures and....... Very good at a reasonable price. MicroSCHC works as expected and have not had any issue whatsoever.  Excellent way to upgrade memory on your mobile device.Highly Recommended. After extensive review / research I wanted the best 64gb available to improve/increase memory for Samsung tab 3 7.0 many cards out there but this one loaded up quickly and appears to be ready for add on apps and preserving meory storage. The price was right, delivered quickly even with holiday, loaded and was quickly loaded/compatible with Samsung tab 3 7.0. Sandisk actually has a use chart that will show shopper what card to use for their device. Very helpful the transfer speed is good the picture quality is good it was shipped to me well packed but not over taped up Purchased for my galaxie 3 phone and it fits and works. Not much else to say. ok, the price was good.Update 06/24/13It stopped working! All of a sudden my phone started alerting me that the sd chip was mounting and dismounting. Caused the battery to drain in a few hours. Everything on the card was lost. I attempted to re-format in my laptop. Card was not found by laptop.Googled the issue and found many blogs of others experiencing the same problem.I will attempt to return to Amazon. I bought two of these - one to go in a Galaxy Tab 8.4 and another to go in a Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. I\\'ve been using both, and haven\\'t had a problem with either of them so far. Died within 6 months! Stopped being able to read or write :( When I went to destroy it, it crumbled easily into tiny pieces. Never again. Purchased this for a fellow employee.  Product came quickly and packaged in original package.  The employee using it is happy. Most mobile devices and tablets that are of any count state that the limit to their sd storage is 32GB...but on a few of those they can and do read sd cards that are in fact larger than this.  I would suggest anyone that thinks they need space beyond those stated limits of their device do a quick search on line for their particular MAKE and Model cellphone or tablet to see what size SD\\'s others have been successful at using. Once you have found out and that you can in fact use such an SD...go and search online for HDD Raw Copy Tool from HDD GURU...and it will allow you to make an image of your old SD to apply to the new SD and/or even make a backup of one\\'s SD.  Since the SD drives are different sizes when this image is applied to the larger...you will need to use a partition manager, such as MiniTool partition wizard (which is free for home use) and resize the partition of the larger drive.  This will allow you to take advantage of the whole drive space. I love the upgrade and added space...can\\'t go wrong with this price for a class 10 SD of this size. Not much to say about this! I ordered it for my Motorola Electrify smartphone and it works perfectly, no issues at all! I\\'m listening to music stored thereon, I read books, plays, etc. from the Gutenberg Project that are stored there.  I download podcasts from ITunes and transfer it to my tablet.  It is wonderful.  I always expect great things from SanDisk.  Would replace it if it stopped working. Got this along with SANOXY Micro USB OTG to USB 2.0 Adapter and Anker Uspeed USB 3.0 Card Reader 8-in-1. Works as described and I now have 64GB of extra space! I use this in my Transformer Infinity tablet as well for a total of 128GB of storage! Slower than expected transfer rates when used with phones and tablets...I had expected higher transfer rates given the data class Excellent price for top rated MicroSDHC Class 10 card with adapter included. SanDisk produces very reliable memory cards have never had one malfunction. Great little card. I have had issues with my phone chewing them up and spitting them out pretty frequently this card seems to have solved that issue for me. Good fast-access memory card. I use it in my Roku player, but it would work equally well in any device that required a micro card. With the adapter I can easily use it in my camera, tablet, desktop P.C. & &#34;Smart&#34; T.V. &#34;Es muy bueno&#34; ! This is the first of these I\\'ve had.  It works as mentioned and have had not problems with it.  Satisfied. I bought it for just 23 USD, it is very fast and reliable, simply the best option for a 10 class micro SD of 32GB.UPDATE:11-08-2013Don\\'t buy it for using it on a Samsung Galaxy S3, there\\'s seem to be an issue between the phone an this particular reference that makes that after a while the MicroSD card lost its data and get nonfunctional. I can\\'t be repair after that, so it gets totally useless. You can tell the card is going to fail before it\\'s too late because constantly the phone shows a notification indicating that the card was ejected and it needs to be mounted again. When this happens I strongly recommend you to backup your data and change the MicroSD card of your phone and use it in other device before it gets corrupted. I got this for my new Microsoft Surface Pro, just in case I needed more room. It comes with a adapter if needed and works great for more storage room. plug in to the phone shows up sd card, but didn\\'t give me the option to format, plug in to the laptop, same thing. Thought it was DOA. But later realized that I had to format the card from the flip down menu. Now it works Perfect. Was going to look for a Gen4 64gb ipod touch, $350 vs $55 makes no sense. Plus The Galaxy S2 T727 works just fine as a media player. In constant use on my Samsung Ativ 700t since January with narry a problem. I just bought my third one :) I can use it to store my data~ It is good for my computer~Also , it is fast~It is a great way to store data~never lost~ Good price. Fast and useful to expand more storage for the newly bought Asus tablet. Build quality looks great. It conveniently came with two adaptors so it can be fit to other computers when copying files. Buyer beware card unreadable from the get go. Luck for me amazon helped me out. There are many others on here that know how to format to Fat32 threw Window 7 and have had same issues. No problem here. I use it in my Samsung Note 10.1. It is a little slow writing to it but such are micro SD cards. It worked for a GoPro so what more to say except I wonder how they can fit 64 gigs on such a small chip. Amazing. Got a really good deal on this humongous capacity card on Black Friday, Thanks Amazon, been waiting for the price to go down.Using this on a Galaxy S3 as FAT 32. I was unable to get this recognized in the phone as an ExFat. Anyone having problems with this in the Galaxy Lineup of phones might want to try the FAT 32 formatting. So far i haven\\'t had any issues. It\\'s working and is compatible with my phone. Quick shipping. Im satisfied with my purchase I ordered this card for my Samsung Note 3.  I had to properly format it for my phone which was easy.  I transferred all of my pictures and music from my old card and it works like a charm.  I picked this card as it is the max the phone allows.  This card was a very good price and I got it next day during the Christmas rush even though I used my free 2 days shipping.I would buy another if I had another device to use it in.I would buy again!As usual, SanDisk is affordable and works well! This sd card is perfect for my phone. It is the right size and especially the right price. After looking all over Amazon price for this card was almost $10 lower than everyone else\\'s. So I got this during the amazon litening deal during black friday for 17$! It is the best and fastest card money can buy. It came in very easy to open packaging. I put it into my Galaxy S3 and was good to go. Highly recommend. Not much else to say - an SD card is an SD card - performance met expectations - have had good luck with Sandisk Easy installation, immediate functionality, great way to expand my phone\\'s photo storage capacity. I am very pleased with this purchase, its ffast light weight.. great price nothing to say here.. just a memory carduse it for my gopro hero 3 black Transfer speeds are consistent with advertising. The card works, and has worked for months now. Great product. Now I need a 64gb..... At least I know which company to go with, SanDisk. it just works great as it supposed to be, i would buy one more for my wife gallaxy S4, thanks! So far this sandisk ultra is working ok.I ran a few tests on it from within my phone before i began using it and the speed was well within reason.it does not read and write at the same speed.so far so good i guess Good price at the time of purchase. Used this on my pda/cellphone device. Has been working without any problems ever since purchased (about 8 months now). I\\'m currently using this product in my Canon Digital Camera, I took over 120 pictures & 20 videos while on vacation in Escondido, Mexico  with more than 85% room still left on the card! Also with me using a micro SD Card, if I wish to send the picture right away I can easily just snap the card into my cell phone to post the pictures to Facebook or email for example? This is a class 10 microSD card, and it works just as advertised. It\\'s very fast- good for recording HD video and such. It\\'s pretty decently priced per gig for a card of its class.However, beware that adapter that comes with it! Put the card in, good luck getting it back out. I made the mistake of doing this to test the memory on my laptop, and actually had to resort to pliers to pull them out, which is probably not a great way to keep the chip in tip-top shape. Note I also said \\'them\\' there- I got two of these and they were both that way, so I doubt it was just a manufacturing defect.Buy the memory, throw away the adapters. Seriously, they are dangerous to use and for all intents and purposes convert it into a standard SD card permanently.Pro:ReliableFastGood priceCon:Adapter: It\\'s a trap! Bought this for my GoPro and it works totally fine (upgrade the firmware if not). It\\'s fast and reliable, as any other card from this series by SanDisk. same as I wrote for all other cards by SanDiskgood qualityworks well for long timea must for extra photos and songs in your cellphone I purchased this for my tablet.  It holds a lot of information and I do not have any problems with this at all I got this for my Samsung Galaxy S5 and could not be happier. It\\'s fast enough with the still and video camera on the phone.I have had no problems transferring files of all types from my pc or tablets. At this price it is a great buy. Works great as advertised.  No problem with formatting or anything.  Appears to be class 10 as advertised.  Thanks a bunch! Works just fine in my video camera in the car.  And I saved over 15 bucks over Best Buy (which always tries to rip you off). Super fast access to my Samsung Galaxy Note II. SanDisk Ultra Micro HC is blazing fast compared to the other microSD cards I have bought including PNY, Sony and more! This was the fastest microSD card I have tested, unfortunately it died after about four months of use in my Android phone. At first my phone would randomly say the card had been removed, then eventually neither the phone nor any reader I had could access it.The test results from my older but still functional 32gb class 4 sandisk:Sequential Read :  23.022 MB/sSequential Write :  4.460 MB/sRandom Read 512KB :  22.387 MB/sRandom Write 512KB :  3.144 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) :  3.414 MB/s [  833.5 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  1.231 MB/s [  300.5 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  3.309 MB/s [  807.8 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  0.993 MB/s [  242.4 IOPS]Compared to this product, 32gb class 10 sandisk:Sequential Read :  41.492 MB/sSequential Write :  15.653 MB/sRandom Read 512KB :  43.380 MB/sRandom Write 512KB :  17.685 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) :  4.696 MB/s [  1146.5 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  1.595 MB/s [  389.4 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  4.859 MB/s [  1186.2 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  1.334 MB/s [  325.6 IOPS] Hello,Great card, great price. Plenty of speed and worked for...about a year. In fact, I wish it had stopped working a month earlier.It looks like Sandisk is out to make sure their cards stop working perfectly after the return window is up or something, because now on the end of December (Return window expired about 20 days ago) this thing only intermittently is recognized. It unmounts all the time in my phone and then gets remounted, and usually it doesn\\'t even remount.While it was a good price, it was a good price for a name brand card that would have lasted longer than a year instead of Sandisk going &#34;ahaha got you good, now you have to buy another expensive name-brand card!&#34;Nope, I\\'ll buy a cheaper alternative and it\\'ll probably last longer. I still have some Kingston\\'s going strong. I have purchased this SD card to have extra storage area for my Galaxy Note 2.  As you might already know, Galaxy Note 2 does not allow applications to run from external cards, but it allows storing media, documents, etc to the external card.  It also comes with a full size SD card conversion piece (just insert the micro sd card into the full size SD card piece and voila) - with it\\'s current pricing on Amazon.com, this card is highly recommended.  Hope this review proves to be useful.Cheers Really helpful I needed to backup some photos and there was plenty of space left No issues it works great in my device. I don\\'t think it would require more words but I\\'ll type them since it\\'s required. I use it to hold files from my computer and transfer files from other computers it works good for this task and is quick. I would recommend this plus the price isn\\'t bad. I bought three of these cards. One died one day (in my Galaxy S3) after about a month and a half of use. The phone said the card was removed unexpectedly, and it never functioned again. The phone still recognized all other cards. I contacted SanDisk, and they shipped out a replacement under warranty.The cards have served me well. Two are in Galaxy S3\\'s, and another in a Galaxy Note II. Copying to them is decently fast, and they are great for music or video storage. Phones have no problem playing 720p video off the cards. I\\'m using this in a point and shoot camera and you will never ever run out of space even with shooting hours of video. I really don\\'t know what to think about this I got it thinking it would solve my memory problems but that\\'s not the case turns out you can only put certain things on this and of course none of the thingsthat are eating up your memory on.your will go there is a way to swap your internal memory for your external card but it\\'s not easy and you have to root  your phone SO I recently got a new Chinese brand Android phone (Inew i4000): Quadcore, 13mp camera, 1GB ram, 16Gb internal storage + MicroSD Support. Also comes with App2SD software support as well.I had an old Samsung Class 10 32GB and tested that it works with the i4000. But wasn\\'t enough for a Power-user like me.Decided to give it the extra storage BOOST!With the Sandisk 64GB Class 10, I now hold within:11GB Music Collection (MP3\\'s at ~192 KBPS)20GB of Graphic Novels/Manga/ManwhaBooks with a Manga App/reader2GB of Apps (migrate the Core apps from internal storage to External storage)8GB of Photos taken with the Phone (uses MicroSD as storage for photos)~30GB of free space left for downloading Movies/MP3s/and documents on-the-goI love this little card, its fantastic and a great way to add some serious expandable storage onto any Smartphone that supports the storage.FYI, I had to format the Sandisk 64GB card using my Smartphone (i4000) in order for it to set the microSD to FAT32. DON\\'T use the PC/laptop to do the format, it will mess it up.Was debating between Class 10 Sandisk 64GB or Class 10 Samsung 64GB, I decided to throw my lot in with the 6000+ reviews for sandisk with an average customer rating of 4.9 Stars. Samsung had 4.9 stars but was from 11 people. So LOL!Highly Recommend this to others! This is pretty cheap I wish the 64GB one had been on sale but this one was priced at about 11 dollars so I can\\'t argue. I have this in my Nokia Lumia 1520 and there is no lag I love this card should have purchased more. what not to like? Works as specified. Recognized correctly when placed in my phone. Adapter may come in handy in future. I purchased the Sandisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC for some extra storage room for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. I was considering the 64 GB, but went with this card because I have the 64GB version on my Galaxy Note 2 phone and I have never come close to needing all that space. Granted, I don\\'t store any music on my phone but I do take a lot of photos/videos and store as many apps on the microSDHC card rather than use the phone\\'s internal memory.For the cost savings of going with the smaller 32GB card, it was a no brainer.The card has worked flawlessly since I installed it on my tablet and have had no problems with it whatsoever. Plus Sandisk is a big name in storage so again, it\\'s a no brainer--- buy it! DO NOT PUT ANY IMPORTANT DATA IN IT. DO NOT USE IT AS A PERMANENT STORAGE TO ARCHIVE IMPORTANT FILES.It just failed after 1.5 months use -- i don\\'t use it too much. Just put all my digital pictures (total: about 30GB) in it and carried in my wallet. I added some more pictures to the disk for a few time in November. Tonight, when I insert it into my laptop, Windows say cannot recognize the disk and said it must be formatted. I tried my MacBook Air and got the same. Neither Mac nor Windows can read it. I formatted it and started to copy the 30+GB pictures again. The copy broke in half way. Cancelled the copy, reinserted the disk and tried to resume the copy. Windows said the volumn is back and told me I must run chkdsk. I ran chkdsk and retried the copy. Still the same failure.I guess the disk has some problem and I don\\'t bother recovering it, since it\\'s not going to be reliable as I expected. Very disappointed. Thought SanDisk is a very good brand. I use SanDisk\\'s CF card in my camera for years and it worked fine. I will fall back to use hard disk to backup my ditigal pictures.So it should be find to use this microSD disk to exchange some large file with friends. But don\\'t put important data in it. Be prepard that it can fail at any time. So far so good. I use this with my mobil phone and the product run smoothly. No issue as of yet. Overall, I\\'m happy with this product. it worked just like you would expect a micro SD card to work, no noticeable issues have come up yet. MicroSD card works flawlessly with my digital video recorder.  No problems at all with playback.  More words needed for official review. I really wanted a 128 GB card, but at less than half the price, as well as actually being in stock right now, this is a good buy, and works well. I couldn\\'t find anyone that would say for sure when I was looking to buy, but this is compatible with Mac. I bought this to stretch the capability of my LG GPad 8.3 GPE tablet.It is working just fine and of course I have total confidence in SanDisk storage items. I bought this Sandisk 16GB Class 10 to use with my HTC Inspire, after 3 months, I am getting constant error saying SD Card unmounted unexpectedly.Then today, the dang fkang card won\\'t even read in the card reader, I have 10GB worth of videos and pictures, memories that I will never be able to get back. I am very upset. Used this for extending the capabilities of my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.  It greatly expands it use and was a snap to install and get started with it. Great card that is very fast and reliable. It comes with an optional adapter for SD slots. Being that this is a Class 10 card it transfers data really fast and for video this is a must! Great for GoPros and other small cameras alike. Good amount of space for the stuff I want to do, and fits in my GoPro. What more can I say? I\\'ve heard bad things about this 64gb Micro SD card crapping out after a few weeks but sk far so good. Transfer speeds are normal but I like to be space. For the price it was a steal!Would recommend.'"
